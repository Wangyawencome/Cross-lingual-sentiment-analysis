And the diaphragm is an extremely sensitive muscle to ATP deficiency. When there is no energy reserve in its cells to work, the diaphragm simply stops. The fact that an infant's diaphragm runs out of energy reserves may be due to various factors. Dr. Szczƒôsny explains that ATP can, for example, be used by the immune system to fight upper respiratory tract infections or harmful substances from cigarette smoke. In addition, the phosphate reserves in the bones are much smaller in the body of low birth weight children. The incorrect sleep position (i.e. . on the stomach) from the point of view of current SIDS prevention guidelines may force the diaphragm to work harder, which also translates into increased energy requirements. Thus, as the biologist supposes, if the risk of sudden cot death is detected, the doctor could, for example, decide to supplement the phosphate deficiency in the body.

In August 2012, there were two large horses and one pony available. You can take riding lessons, ride on a lunge, and more advanced riders can take a ride in the forest. In the forester's lodge there is a representative of the smallest horse species, there are also two sheep and a very friendly female Sabinka.
