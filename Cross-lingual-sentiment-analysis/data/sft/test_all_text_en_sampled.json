I went to Dr. Niebrzydowski from neurosurgery referral. The doctor is really nice, factual, has a lot of knowledge, but he recommended me two months of treatment with a million pills, which gave nothing. The pain of the fact has passed, but I can bet that it wasn't the pills, because those pills were on completely different. When my family doctor told me what medications I was taking at the vaccination test, he opened his eyes wide with surprise. It seemed like the best doctor - most opinions, positive ones in addition, but I am really disappointed.

Besides, before he recommended it to me she got a prescription for a very nice ointment and pills, after which new acne foci are no longer formed - I do not complain and I very much praise your cook = )\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:I feel very sorry for your loss of the child. However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side. Once again, I am very sympathetic to you and wish you good luck, as well as read the reading and proper preparation for your next pregnancy.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:She had a chance to spend New Year's Eve in \" Avoiding \".

We often stay in 3 star rooms, but this hotel has disappointed us a lot. Perhaps the main building is different and we were accommodated in one of the additional buildings at the back of the hotel. The rooms are as clean as possible. The furniture is scratched, the bathroom door is overgrown with mould. A very small shower. Place in the bathroom covered with a curtain - do not turn around if you do not want to stick to it . The glass shelf hanging above the washbasin is tilted at an angle so that you will not put anything there because everything is going to come off. You keep your cosmetics in the room because nothing else will fit there. The family room is made up of two bedrooms separated by a door, but only one has an air conditioner. In the part without it, in the heat, you can not stand it. The air conditioner itself worked flawlessly except for the external unit which made the sound of a take-off plane. If you want to cool down the room before bedtime, you will not sit on the balcony and still you will only cool down one of them because nothing will get to another. The kitchen has a fridge and that's a plus, but also wandering food ants. When we happen to leave anything to eat on the counter. You had the impression that everything would come out on its own. Deep pool cleaned daily, no war over sunbeds. Breakfast, well, poor choice and poor quality all under English tourists. Eternal queues to the toaster, waiting for cups, plates and pieces. The constantly spoiled drinks machine. It overheated and had to wait for it to cool down. Very nice ladies serving, but they only two and the accumulation for breakfast from 9 - 10 so they barely made up. We spent all day long outside the hotel, but when he came in the evening, he did not want to go back there. They asked us to change the room, but we heard that there was no chance because the occupancy was full. The distance from the sea is over a kilometer.

    "input": "According to Krzakowski, performing genetic tests is not a waste of money, because it allows to avoid unnecessary treatment of the patient with an expensive targeted drug or to save on them always cheap chemotherapy and treatment of its complications. Targeted therapy not only prolongs the survival of patients, but is usually better tolerated than chemotherapy. Research has shown, for example, that the treatment of chemotherapy is not only prolonged but also better tolerated than chemotherapy. The quality of life of patients treated with kryzotinib is much better than that of patients undergoing chemotherapy. The experts emphasized that in Poland there is a problem with financing genetic research, among others in patients with lung cancer. The National Health Fund wants to reimburse money only for tests performed in those patients in whom genetic change will be detected. As Krzakowski explained, this means that out of 100 patients tested for a mutation in the EGFR gene, the fund will pay only for 10 patients in whom it will be found. The cost of one such test ranges from 300 to 500 PLN, so it is completely unprofitable for hospitals.",

So yes - I had no exorbitant expectations about this place, especially since I have read many forums and pages with opinions, but I honestly state that with every negative opinion I agree 100%. All inclusive is not even a drama, but rather a bottom line. Alcohol is issued in a room by the pool. The lady stands behind a shelf of the type from which it seems galvanized ice cream and funnels into plastic cups of vodka, crampons or brandy. In order to create a drink I have to pour dramatic quality juice from the distributor myself. There is no ice for drinks, no coke. There's nothing. The restaurant is a second failure. There is one, the only, tiny one, and we, as we are with the executive, have had us eat somewhere else, but unfortunately. No choice of dishes, although bad ones are not. The queue for food is slightly 40 minutes standing. The restaurant on the hotel premises is a mass, but only one for the all inclusive option. And now the worst is the beach, it's just a massacre. All so dirty that a man is disgusted to sit down. Old umbrellas, loungers barely alive and ubiquitous dirt. At the very entrance to the sea, we were joyfully greeted by a drifting headliner and other rubbish - paper, polystyrene. Drama. Every now and then somebody walks around with a commercial offer, you can't order in peace. A 6-year-old boy was selling beer and asked us to buy it from him. The worst thing is that we have to survive here 13 more days and we really deeply inundate our choice. I doubt that in the next few days something will improve, but the first impression is a total massacre. As far as the advantages are concerned, there are two - the executive room is very nice and spacious and the pool. This is where the pluses end: ) The holiday cost us a hell of a lot of money, because we're supposed to be here for 15 days and yet she paid me for the executive room, which had to obligate even to eat in another section, but apart from the fact that it looks better than standard, there are no privileges.

This is particularly true of near-infrared light with wavelengths between 650 and 850 nanometres (a nanometer is a millionth of a millimetre). The properties of the blood - specifically haemoglobin, whose oxidized form interacts with light in a different way than the reduced form - are important here. This phenomenon allows to assess the degree of oxygenation of the observed part of the body by analysing the intensity of light penetrating the tissue. The basic elements of optical diagnostic devices are small light sources (laser diodes) and sensitive photodetectors. Sources and detectors, usually 2 - 5 cm apart, are put together in pairs. The patient's head can be put into several to several such pairs at the same time, which potentially allows to examine a significant part of the brain.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:We were expecting a romantic stay and in the meantime we met with great disappointment. It started with a parking lot from which the passage looked almost like a survival school. After the rain, it was impossible to go through without the galleys. A hole in the hole - drama .

Could someone kindly who treated himself in 4WSK to Dr. Gavr\u00ed\u015b answer me how this quarterly registration looks like? Do you have to come on the first day of registration and stand in line, e.g. at 4 am because there will be no more places later? You hear various things about registering to good specialists and so far I have not had the pleasure because I was not sick. . . Besides, I have a question whether if I get an appointment and get treated, will I have to wait for the next one for 3 months again or will the doctor himself set me a deadline? And is such a quarterly way of registering for specialists as in Weigel's case rather the norm or does it look different in other institutions (with NFZ agreement)? Thank you in advance for your answer. I think it will also be useful for others who are not familiar with it. . . Greetings\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in December. We were there with a trip abroad. In many rooms it was just cold, we had to ask for blankets or extra heaters. The rooms in the hotel were fine, although they were not crazy. Breakfast in total tasty, large, standard choice. The staff tried to do their best, although sometimes they were misleading (it was a form of payment for the stay) and had to repeat two or three times what it was about. The hotel has no parking and the bus had to stand very far away. The advantage is undoubtedly the location in the very centre. I do not know if it deserves 3 stars .\nAnswer:ambivalent",

The mystery was quickly solved. . . . Generally, the hotel is an accommodation base for trips from all over Poland that visit the park in Inwa\u0142d. If someone wants to rest there in silence, he or she may be quite disappointed. The acoustics of the rooms are so poor that you can hear everything that is happening in the corridor and in the next room (not know why the rooms are connected by a door). As the door is a cheap piece of crap like many in supermarkets you can hear everything and everyone. Bathrooms in the rooms have a kind of threshold - which I don't know why, but if you forget, it hurts a lot. The standard is that you can't hear anything without any fireworks. It's pretty clean. Breakfast is quite decent and that's it. Mini SAPA and something like a playroom for children - my son didn't even want to go in there.

The hotel is a very good place to get to the hotel, but it is not easy to get to the hotel alone, you have to go off the asphalt road to a dirt road that leads through a lot of unevenness. The hotel itself is located in a beautiful area between two lakes, so those who like contact with nature will not be disappointed. Checking in at the hotel's reception went smoothly, we reached the room by the stairs located next to the reception. Since they were traveling with two children, they chose a two-storey family room. However, the room was not well cleaned (on the carpet chips, a cobweb in the corners of the wall, a broken liquid feeder for bathing in the shower, under the shower a stone visible to the naked eye, the gasket at the bottom of the shower was clearly not replaced since the dawn because it had already had a yellow air raid, no light bulb in the ceiling lamp) In addition, the room had a stove because it was quite cool but despite the fact that it was on all the time, the temperature in the room was not high enough. Despite reporting defects in the room at the reception, these defects were not removed and we were not proposed to change the room. However, we received a set of soaps and bathing liquids. Ned long after check-in we used the swimming pool area, unfortunately, and here disappointment because the water in the pool was cold (it certainly had a lot below the ottoman's level of 28 degrees), dry sauna instead of having 90 degrees had only 49 degrees and despite an attempt to raise the temperature with the controller unfortunately we did not succeed.

From the bathroom there is a smell of sewage system. The hotel is located near a busy street and it is better to choose rooms with a view of the Palazzo Hotel. What was the worst thing about the hotel was the boarding. We had the option All - inclusive. Breakfast is a failure and the largest with bread a few bread rolls and bread and toast probably the cheapest possible. Daily scrambled eggs, planted eggs and hard-boiled eggs. There were two sausages. Besides, beans. The meat is worse than our cheapest mortadella. Fruit and vegetables to every meal - it's a plus. Coffee and drinks from the machine not to drink . As for other drinks it is tea and cherry, apple and grapefruit juices had a very strange taste. Only in the coffee corner of the vending machine you can drink the original fanty, sprite, cola and so on. In addition, water from vending machines without limits. Lunches and dinners with this were different. Better than breakfasts but not perfect. Always potatoes toasted or french fries for that some meat in sauce mostly chicken. Several times there were fish and often fillets in the coating (such fakes of our Frosty) . From 15 spikes in the pool bar, always fries and muffins, once fried cheese in a breadcrumbshell. Some cakes and fruit. From 10 in the pool bar, ice cream and spirits. The bartenders do not save on spirits. I recommend a drink called Tropic. Pool clean in the morning you can see on the steps of undissolved chlorine in granules water colder than in the sea . Unfortunately, deckchairs occupied early in the morning . The lifeguard even though present is still looking at the phone . When it comes to animation, there was no failure . Two animators . Every day 30 minutes . with songs for children for adults was also something . Once a Bulgarian evening, once a karaoke . There is also a small children's playground near the pool. To the sea I recommend to get between the hotels across the street at the main exit of the hotel. It is closest to the wooden footbridge and at night the lighting.

A small pool, almost no animation at all, even though the hotel is said to have a 100% occupancy rate (and this is May). The beds have been occupied since the morning, there is nowhere to lie down by the pool. They paid us for the sea view, and we got a view of the city and a giant construction site. The sea can be seen from the side, and the hotel and Ithaca claim that it is after all a view of the sea, although partial (of course it was not marked anywhere). Drama, you can not go out on the balcony, construction work in the surrounding buildings, but also in the hotel itself continues throughout the day. We have read earlier opinions about the fact that they treat Poles worse in hotels and that Ithaca has the worst rooms, but for the first time we felt it. The reception desk of the hotel but also the care of Ithaca is not helpful at all - they offered us an exchange for a room with a slightly better view, but much smaller, and the gentleman from the reception desk said bluntly that better rooms are for other guests, not from Ithaca. The food is monotonous, very little choice, although you have to admit that it's mostly tasty. Fish or waffles like kids' waffles disappear with a second and then you have to wait a long time until they add (by the way one or two amateur machines that make 4 small waffles at a time for such a big hotel are weak). In addition to the main meals the food in all inclusive very weak, drinks and alcohols also. The beach by the hotel is small, ugly and dirty, sun beds of course paid. The neighborhood is ugly, the town itself also. On Zakynthos is a lot of much better and cheaper hotels, certainly the second time we do not come here.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:The hotel, in my opinion, is good, close to the beach but has no sun beds.

Cook who cooks on a regular basis, nice service. Every day some themed evenings unfortunately we had the opportunity to be on only one: flamenco show. I really liked it. Besides, the pool, rather small with a view of the sea. Some animations in the form of games, zumba, aqua gym. The hotel has gyms but we did not use them.

The tragedy of the photo and the opinions written earlier are 100% true . In my opinion, if you go on holiday it's better to throw in something and have a holy peace and good time and not watch it quiet what is going on there. If I wasn't from the travel agency, I'd only spend one day there. The view of the sea, which gives offices is a mockery because he is not behind the trees and the big blue hotel. There is an old ping-pong table with no net and no pallets. The cleaners are doing a good job you have to admit. The only ones holding the level. The water stands in the bathroom, the water barely flows down the toilet. The ghost has to pay for everything. The fridge cools down the bdb TV with 4 channels which is 20 years old. The challenges are a tragedy. I thought they no longer do so in catering but I was wrong because such restaurants fall naturally.

I have a feeling that you expect Dr. Romanik to come and bring you tea! The doctor is not going to gossip, as some people think, but to be cured. I can't stand that you love to complain (anonymously), but it's better to spit on someone under the cover of MASKA than to stand up and say straight in the eyes.

Measured by his factual advice, I entered a \"difficult\" adolescence. I'm not writing this to feel a little bit sorry for myself. I just wanted to point out that despite the teenager's stubborn character, the Doctor managed. From what he noticed, he develops a separate way of communicating for each of his patients, which corresponds to the needs and character of the patient. Apart from the purely medical advice, he received em other, more lifelike advice. This shows that Mr. Nogal is a sensitive and conscious man. He is very direct, which can only be read as a plus, it is easier for him to establish a thread of understanding. If I don't know anything about medicine, I can judge it, I think his help is professional. The visits were not too long, they did not last too short, they left without any confusion in my head, which can often appear after a conversation with a specialist. As for the Doctor's personal culture, I would very much like every doctor to be distinguished by such a distinction. Thank you : )",

For Poles in the evening no attractions, at 23 . 00 the life in the hotel was dying. Wi - Fi paid, so even the Internet is missing. A great advantage of the hotel and TUI were activities for children aged 4 - 12 years in the Polish-speaking Scan Holiday Club. It's just a pity that in the evening animations Polish children were left out, and the games were conducted solely for children from England, and on the second scene from Sweden and Norway.

There is basically no beach at the hotel, there are only stones. On a piece of beach near the hotel, sun loungers for a fee and no bar all inclusive. The pools are average, with one small slide. The food is delicious, varied, a paradise for gloves. Poles located on the first and second floor, overlooking the canopy of the restaurant. The beautiful view of the ocean was said to have been on the upper floors, which were occupied by tourists from England and Scandinavia. The resident was very unpleasant and reluctant to answer questions. The island is beautiful and worth a visit! ! ! We rented a car and drove around the most interesting places - it is worth seeing such cities as Maspalomas and Puerto Rico, the beaches of Anfidelmare and Amadores (these are super holiday locations), and the Quayadeque Gorge with the natives' apartments in the rocks.

The book is the last volume of the Hussite Trilogy and it would be said that the end ends with the work, but . . . Well, that's right. The author probably exaggerated.

Yes, as if Sapkowski tried to break the record in the accumulation of climaxes per page of text .

No novel can consist only of climaxes, it harms the reader, like an excess of candy in the diet, and a similar effect - the reader overeats and that's it. Fortunately, there are also good sides to it. Our hero finally grows up, gets bearable, sometimes he even gets to like himself. The historical background is still great, you can still see an in-depth knowledge of the author. The language of the novel is simply excellent, the descriptions of the horrors of war are stuck in the memory. And what has fun, is fun.

The support changes the schedule of the busy couple without any problems and adapts it to the couple's proposals. Very professional fitness instructors, eager to share their knowledge. I have not managed to ask a question that would not be left unanswered. Tasty food and energy value well matched to the guest's lifestyle. Treatments in the SPA very pleasant and professionally made . The only downside was the lack of air in the radiators in the room and the lack of traffic jam in the sink, into which a small soap notoriously fell. I strongly recommend and I will come back!\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:There are more and more advertising opportunities. This means higher return on investment, but also higher costs. If you consider advertising in search engines, metasearch platforms, remarketing, channel manager fees and similar expenses it is very easy to get lost and overpay. This is a sensitive topic and each hotel should be analyzed individually. My golden rule is that the cost of purchase should be at half the average commission paid to OTA. So if the hotel pays an average commission of 22%, then 11% to download a direct reservation is a good CTA (cost per acquisition). What is your forecast for 2016? What trends can be innovative or bring new sales opportunities? Metasearch platforms are becoming important.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The headphones have already been withdrawn from production - the opinion writes as a warning to possible amateurs of goods from sale or second hand. I chose these headphones because of the ( apparently ) excellent workmanship and sound quality . The headphones sound really good: the sound is slightly dimmed but not dull - the treble and midrange are very saturated, the bass is also great and, contrary to some opinions, well balanced - e.g. . It does not interfere with the message in intimate recordings. The list of advantages is complemented by high wearing comfort and excellent isolation from the environment. Unfortunately, my idyll with M1 lasted only half a year - after this period (probably) the cable inside the headband broke down - which is odd because the headphones are not folded, so the damage probably occurred as a result of a simple adjustment when putting them on your head. In my copy, fortunately, the pads did not peel off - which is supposedly a typical case of this model (on the mp3store forum there is even a separate thread on this subject). Of course, the product is under warranty, but Philips does not service it anymore so I will receive a refund. The lack of service for the model for 900 - 1000 PLN (catalogue price), introduced to the market two or three years ago, proves the worst for the manufacturer.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL ! ! ! We were guests of this hotel for a week in August. The hotel, despite the refreshment of the rooms (painting and change of upholstery), dirt was visible to the naked eye in every hotel room, i.e. in the restaurant, pool, lobby, rooms where curtains of dirt and old age were falling apart. The water in the taps, on the other hand, had such low pressure that it did not fly but dripped. It is all because of the savings, as well as the lack of any Polish program on TV, German and English alone. As for the food, it left a lot to be desired. A very modest menu, even as for a 3 star hotel. And what's very important, the AROGANCANCY AND SAFETY MANAGER, who allegedly has 15 years of experience in the industry and apparently about 15 years not enough. Her answer to the problems that we reported was that the number of guests is important and others will come anyway. Room prices are very exorbitant and the hotel is not worth even half of these prices. And when it comes to the beaches in \u0141eba, the sea takes the beaches, compared to previous years, the beach is 10-15 meters narrower. We do not recommend this hotel, because it is a waste of money. . .\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Hotel in a very good location, beautiful sea views, you can enjoy all inclusive in the entire complex of all hotels except Royal Castle. The lifts actually work poorly but we lived on the 3rd floor so you could quickly go up the stairs. The food is very good, the choice of huge delicious cheeses, aubergines, fresh vegetables, delicious pickled herrings and mosquito nets, meat in various forms also grilled. If someone there is hungry and doesn't find anything for himself it is probably abnormal. There are a few disadvantages but this is Bulgaria so you have to get used to, if someone is a Parisian dog then I do not recommend it. The alcohols are pouring without limits but be careful because it can be hard on the other day. Lots of fun and animation for children, discos, etc .\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:What can women's breast implants, a piggy bank, Harry Potter's wand and a bucket of live crabs have in common? Hotel.

As for 13 million people who stayed overnight in 2012 in 38 thousand rooms of Travelodge chain, this is quite a good result.

The service is quite oily - the manager has not found an alternative to the terrible noise coming from outside, floors higher definitely better standards, for the same price. In the building you could hear everything (even a neighbour's shower on the upper floors). By the pool cleaned from time to time. You can get up. The only thing that could save you from the evening was a party in the bar or an evening show organized by Animators in the \"amphi\" theater, tasty food, nicely prepared, in this respect everything is OK. Jakkuzi was closed during his stay. Sauna for a separate charge. Generally I recommend a trip in season and probably at once.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

But the cherry on the cake turned out to be the bathroom. Apart from the mould in the shower cabin (although it is difficult to call the cabin a piece of floor separated by a curtain) and the nightmarish, chemical (something like vinegar) smell of towels turned out that there is no radiator in it! I assure you that in Polish climate conditions, bathing in a bathroom without heating in November is not a pleasant experience. The charm of bitterness was passed by a light switch placed directly in the headrest of the bed - 3 times during the night woke up m after accidentally turning on the light. The only advantage for me is the location - close to the old town .",

The next visit was also arranged by the portal Known Physician and the aim of the procedure was to inject platelet-rich plasma. The visit was scheduled for Saturday for an hour. 10 . 00 . In the centre there was em at 09 . 45 , where 4 spiders were waiting . My turn was at 10 a.m. 10 . 30 , which was the first unpleasant surprise. I will only mention that the arrival of 45 minutes in the cooled waiting room at - 8 C outside is not comfortable. The second surprise was the fact that at the moment the patient who was in front of me tried to enter the office, a patient who appeared a long time after I came to the office. He claimed that he had an appointment. The doctor confined himself to stating that we are delayed. That was enough for me and he gave 'em up on the visit and treatment. The situation that happened to me should be characteristic of the state health service and not the private office. He assumed that due to the quite high cost of the procedure and the necessity to repeat it several times, I can count on a decent level of service. Fortunately, the patient can vote with his legs. What do I hereby do .\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:On the scale 1 - 5 Dr. Wojtyga deserves 10. There are not many such doctors. Communicative, but also concrete .

He listened carefully to the symptoms, conducted a thorough examination, described in detail and in an accessible way the way of treatment and application of medicines. And all this without looking at his watch and the rush typical of many doctors. We were on vacation and after a fatal treatment by a \"specialist\" from Zakopane, 2 or 5 hours we went to see Dr Marcin. We do not regret a minute spent in the car. If we hadn't come from Wroc\u0142aw (450 km away from Gryb\u00f3w), we would certainly have chosen a doctor as our family doctor.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Interestingly, in Krakow's hostels in these holidays the prices for accommodation in double rooms were higher than in 3 * hotels. For example, in the cult hostel Good By Lenin a room cost 150 - 160 zloty with breakfast and in the hotel Best Western Galicya you could buy it on booking.com for 124 zloty. And an air-conditioned room in a 4 * Swing hotel cost 200 zloty. And in the hostel there were no free rooms and in the hotels - yes . What makes customers pay such prices for a low, hostel standard?

During the next visits the child was comprehensively examined, without hurry and in a pleasant atmosphere. I ask many questions and all of them were answered without any trace of irritation.

After consultation with the doctor, I decided to have a second operation, this time a full correction. Currently, the nose has a slightly better shape, no less, however, it is far from looking bad. The bone is on the one hand unevenly sawn (the doctor's attention was drawn to it during the check-up visit - she heard that it is probably still the wound after the surgery and should heal). The unevenness has remained until today. To sum up, yes, the nose looks a bit better than before the surgery, however, after two treatments she expected a much better effect.

Professor Warmus reserves that such conclusions should be drawn carefully. \"Theoretically we are dealing here with a situation in which it would be possible to reduce or slow down the absorption of sugar from starch and thus prevent hyperglycemia or excessive sugar absorption\" - he said in an interview with PAP. Potentially this means \"some chance in the context of obesity problems, which is nowadays the size of a pandemic\" - he added .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Dr. \u0141abiak had an ultrasound confirming the pregnancy in the 7th week.

Usually the histopathological examination is done after the surgery, so if the surgeon does not manage to find all the sick lymph nodes, another surgery may be needed. The modernised probe would allow the surgeon to see which lymph nodes are occupied during the operation and the surgeon could cut out all the cancer tissue and the occupied nodes in one operation,\" said the scientist. Currently, the probe works on a spot. Scientists want to develop a device that will scan the entire surface of the removed tissue. Work is also underway to increase the sensitivity of the probe.

Later I was treated for over a year in the infertility clinic to which she referred me and everything she said was confirmed, which means that she knew what she was saying.

It turns out that the need to take care of oneself often depends on being in a relationship. This is not only about health, but also about hygiene. It is only the intimate relationship that motivates one to maintain it more.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:I share Dr. Agrawal's opinion that poor nutrition and stress are the greatest dangers to the body's organism, as I have found out by going on a proper diet and I can see that there are few doctors who holistically look at humans. Dr. Agrawal made a very good impression on me at the beginning because of her positive energy and peace of mind, and she was enthusiastic about her recommendations, she took care of my health because her diagnosis was very convincing. However, she convinced me once again to be sensible to treat such methods as well. Unfortunately, the doctor made a wrong diagnosis - excess estrogen, which she decided to confirm with blood tests. It turned out that my hormones are normal. If I hadn't checked it, today I would have been lubricated with ointment with progesterone written down by the Doctor, but why? I am also not convinced to recommend the so-called 'em - these are beneficial bacteria (with a mixture of herbs), and as you know, such bacteria are needed in the intestines, so they must first pass through the stomach. Drinking such a liquid with bacteria, whether they are able to survive in the stomach - rather poor chances so I prefer to take the current market symbiotics in special capsules. However, I can see very good effects after the Sunny concoction (olive oil, alocite, lemon) prescribed by the doctor. Natural methods of treatment are great - but girls, be careful, complement this knowledge with simple research and your own intuition. I guess she would be afraid to entrust me with leading the pregnancy with the Doctor, unless I have another doctor at the same time. Although I agree with many things, I think it's all too much responsibility, and most of all, the doctor, who calls himself holistic, doesn't pay enough attention to one thing.

The building has a very \"cult\" look and equipment for lovers of the 70s. Enough bathrooms, always hot water, a kettle in the hallway at guests' disposal, nice staff. There is enough furniture in the rooms to place things. Televisions that remember the old times can be obtained to the room for an additional fee. Rooms are spacious.

The examination should last about 1 - 1 , 5h , the doctor wrapped himself in 20 minutes. He said that everything looks perfect, he took 3 pictures because there was no more sense, there is no trace of tumor.

She was happy that the tumor had disappeared, but fortunately my doctors did not let this diagnosis fool them.

I had 4 fistulas in 1985, including one around the sphincter. After the surgery, which was performed by the doctor himself, it turned out that this fourth fistula did not operate on me. 3 other fistulas were fine. The most difficult fistula was operated on in a military hospital. Dr. Hamdi told me that it is dangerous to operate the fistula around the sphincter because you can damage the sphincter during the operation and \"I'll do it underneath\". My assessment - only \"I recommend\" - is due to the fact that he did not undertake this fistula operation, which he did not inform me about. This is not good. However, if he was not able to operate this fistula, it is good that he did not take it. He could have screwed up the operation and explained that he had warned me. The most important thing in this profession is not to hurt the patient. Besides, he treated me nice and after the second operation in a military hospital he let me come to the hospital to change the dressing. By the way, he watched my second operation (this type of wounds are not sewn up after surgery but they are supposed to cleanse themselves and heal themselves). so he wanted to learn something.

It is based on surveys, which on the one hand makes a person feel a little bit like on an exam, but on the other hand, the person is able to determine the size of the problem.\nAnswer:ambivalent",
    "input": "I can't assess the competence of the doctor because he fixed only one tooth - time will show if there will be problems with it in the future. The filling was quickly set up, which is a plus for me. I have comments on the visit itself. First of all, there was a considerable delay. Secondly, the doctor could not open the photo of the teeth recorded on the cd, explaining that he would have to install a special program and would not do it. Therefore, he did the examination himself (paid examination, even though she was treating his tooth). As for the review I have mixed feelings - only one cavity was diagnosed, while another doctor found six - who is right - I do not know yet. The doctor urged me not to treat the tooth ( ? ! ! ), giving unclear reasons for me - that the loss is but not very urgent to repair, that I will think calmly at home if I trust him, etc . Because she drove half of Warsaw to get to the office, she wanted to cure my tooth. I guess the rebirth was connected with a considerable delay anyway, although this was not confirmed by the doctor. Although the tooth was treated quickly, I was not informed about anything (except that I will feel a sting under anesthesia). For a person with a strong vomiting reflex (as the doctor warned me after entering the office) such comments are very important. Also important for me were breaks, which the doctor did not do. The office itself is a bit deterrent, although it is a matter of taste. In the middle of a huge room one dental chair - above it a big lamp. For me the scenery is not very pleasant, a bit like a horror movie and even a TV set on the wall does not help ;) For this price I require more involvement and feeling for the patient. In general I advise against it, especially for people who have far away.",

Very good food, nicely served with very nice service. Unfortunately the hotel itself has a very uninteresting location, far from the sea and at a very busy crossroads. Room 122 offered to us as a double room is a total failure. This type of rooms do not offer even the subordinate guesthouses. The room is tiny, cluttered, gray and burgundy; the TV set must be on the fridge because there is no other place. The only thing you can gain in this room is bruises. On the bed a one-person duvet, every night we were doing a draw who is to cover himself with it. Well, there were wooden beams in the room, then at least they nailed one hanger to them. Bathroom, that's another failure. Shower by the sherry. 70 cm, washing only in it in the position \"at attention\" (and that for slim people) . Bathroom equipment is only towels, soap and hair dryer. In a word, room 122 is beyond any category (large better rooms and better equipped rented in hotels without stars). Only the price is a 4-star hotel.

The hotel has a category * * Superior, but when it comes to room and service, it quietly meets the 3 * requirements. We had a family room with one double bed and one bunk bed; and with air conditioning. The room was very clean, daily cleaned, bed linen, refilled and changed towels. In terms of cleanliness, nothing can get attached to anything. A nice surprise was that on the hot days after returning to the room it was cool, the staff left the air conditioning on. This is unthinkable in other hotels, where saving electricity is a high priority. An additional advantage is the free hotel parking, which is a rare occurrence in Dresden and European cities in general. Now the minus is breakfast. A person used to the 3 - 4 * standard in Polish hotels will be unpleasantly surprised. Due to the lack of typical cuisine there are practically no hot dishes. The only exception was eggs cooked in an ovary. In addition, there was a vending machine (a big plus) with a large selection: water for tea, coffee, espresso, latte, cocoa. The small selection of bread, the level of cold cuts and cheeses does not wash to Polish cuisine - mortadella, salceson and the like. The absence of indispensable scrambled eggs and sausages, not to mention slices of bacon. No fresh cheeses, no sweet coffee snacks. All products in mini boxes - jam, honey, butter, cheese, p\u00e2t\u00e9-like products . To sum up - breakfast does not knock down, however, the traveler will enjoy a peaceful holiday. Taking into account the still relatively attractive price for breakfast as for Dresden - 7, 5 EUR adult, 3 EUR child - with an average of 10 EUR per person - it is worth considering its purchase. Most importantly, the hotel is very close to the old town. Next to it is Yenidze, and after a 10-minute walk we reach Zwinger Palace, where the Baroque madness begins - Zwinger marathon, Semporoper, Residentschloss, Hofkirche, Frauenkirche, Albertinum. . . . To sum up, the hotel is a good place to recommend. Quite an attractive price for a great location. And of course free parking. And a clean room. Breakfast - you can eat. If you don't want to pay 7,5 EUR for a morning meal, you can buy yourself 1,3 EUR tea or coffee at the vending machine and have breakfast on your own.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Every day, we are annoyed by people talking loudly on their mobile phones in the street, in mass media, at the shop counter ...

In 2010, they were performed half as many as in 1996, and the percentage of syphilis cases diagnosed in this period doubled.

He switched his uncle's hatchet for a stick? After his Uniden, M-Tech is a showcase of reception, range and communicativeness. ASQ works great, no knobology in Uniden has achieved so much! The failure of this radio is a jumping RF Gain (i.e. in M-Tech Local / DX.) The radio simply can't hear anything! Generally a maintenance-free receiver on tour. It hears far and wide. After the city - turn off ASQ and set the SQ knob . Or make sure that the Local / DX does not serve as Mute . Great price .

If I'm to sum it up in one word: weakness. The arguments on the plus side : - location - to the lake near, the hotel is located on the sidelines so also far from civilization . - Food (lunches only) Arguments to the minus: - attractions in the hotel - on the website you can read that there is a bowling alley, wellness and spa area, gym, bajkolandia. I will describe them briefly. Bowling alley: you can write about it that there is a bowling alley. And that's it. Out of 3 tracks one is completely out of use, 2 others are in an almost agonal state. Bowling is constantly falling down, the track is curved . Wellness and spa area: this includes: a swimming pool, namely 2 pools (a small one for children about 50cm deep and a bigger one about 170cm deep.) There is also a jacuzzi and 2 saunas. In the small pool, the water is cloudy, massacrically chlorinated, but relatively warm. In a large pool, the water is cooler and a little less chlorinated. The Jacuzzi either did not work (no possibility of manual control of the nozzles from the panel on the bathtub), or was polluted with something. The saunas even worked, although I don't know if there was such a temperament in them as was displayed on the controllers. To this I must add that the ceiling was falling off at times and it was a little dark. Gym - in the room there were: stepper (damaged in my opinion), atlas - life-threatening - broken rope rolls, wipes on the backrests and rods. Orbiter - not working . 3 bicycles, one of which is relatively efficient. The defects were reported to me already on the day of arrival - it was drenched . The solarium and whirlpool were unfortunately not checked by me, but probably their condition is similar. Bajkolandia - short - SYF . The equipment to play destroyed, the trampoline destroyed and threatening safety, balls everywhere and not in the pool, sometimes exposed tubes (should be protected with a sponge). Reported defects - defects cast! . There are also a few vending machines, but additionally paid for, so they are working. Rooms: we had the misfortune to spend the night / visit in 3 rooms: 159, 157 and 124 . Because some of the rooms are designed for colonial groups so: handles in the door fall out, windows do not close, mushroom on the walls (159) . In 157 conditions a little better, but there is no ideal. In 124, after the rain comes out a mushroom on the walls and ceiling, night lights badly screwed on, threatening life and health. The air conditioning is but not cool. WiFi is but with me on 3 phones the connection was broken. Food - lunches ok - every day a little different menu, tasty. Breakfast every day the same (scrambled eggs with flour, sausage, croutons, sausages (unfortunately the cheapest)). The problem is that the service did not keep up with the change of service, so there were no plates, cups, hot water for coffee, often and the next portions of food. The rooms were not ready at 4 p.m. - the service is not done. Another problem - colonies - noise, mess, mess. Beach - close, but neglected, little sandy, additional attractions paid for (canoes, water bikes). To sum up . If you want to rest it is not there (colonies). A beautiful place, but not used.

For the former, very often the guest is just a number - a statistic that earns them more money. For the latter, the guest is a person, often treated very individually. In this case, unforced and natural hospitality dominates. This is because the basis is the needs of the person, not the owner.

    "instruction": "You are a sentiment classification model. Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:I've been to the Doctor's for a few visits. She was recommended by another gynaecologist because she was observing gynaecological and endocrine problems at my place. The first visit was OK, she even wanted to put me in the hospital to do a full package of tests. But she decided that I would do it myself on the basis of a referral (I have childhood trauma in hospital). Most of the tests came out normal. But I was trying to get a baby. The doctor was not worried about the elevated slight LH, she missed the description of the ovarian ultrasound indicating PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) . The TSH was also too high, which for women applying for a child should not be higher than 2 (and preferably 1 or 8). Apart from the tests, she had a number of other symptoms. The doctor recommended to continue her efforts for half a year and then, if she fails, return to the consultation. Of course, the efforts failed because I probably did not ovulate at all, because my bubbles did not ripen. She felt that I wasn't going with this Doctor anymore. But she gave her one more chance. First she went for a consultation with another doctor, who ordered me to do, among other things, an AMH test - a basic examination of the ovarian reserve, from which I should start treatment. It became clear that I had PCOS. She started me on another visit armed with additional results, confirming my guesses, and the doctor looked at the results (including AMH) and said that everything is normal. Her next recommendation is again half a year's effort. After this visit she went to another doctor recommended to me for difficult cases. He said at the outset that there was a thyroid problem due to TSH, recommended a change of diet due to PCOS and also pointed out a slight hyperinsulinemia, which unfortunately often accompanies ovarian disease. Conclusion: The doctor doesn't listen to the patients when they talk about the symptoms or underestimate them The doctor doesn't know what are the recommendations of TSH levels for women trying The doctor doesn't read the test results carefully and doesn't think about them She didn't give the lowest marks just because the doctor is nice, polite, nice and tries to calm down when the efforts don't come out. So what? Her persuading natural efforts when there are serious hormonal problems can cause discouragement, resentment and mental fatigue and this can lead to a crisis in relationships trying to have a child.

He adds that substances secreted by bacteria can e.g. change the action of e.g. digestive enzymes or bile, and it is very important in absorbing fats or vitamins contained in them. The set of genes of our small tenants (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites) are microbial. It is easy enough for a microbiome to be examined by analyzing a faecal sample and sequencing the genes contained therein. Each of us has a slightly different microbiome that works a little differently. This, among other things, makes it easy for some people to gain weight in addition to our own genes, and for others to make concessions in their diet.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The doctor is not nice, I don't like visiting her (we are only in emergencies, because we are the closest ones).

It consists of a sudden and transient disorder of the systolic function of the heart muscle. The clinical picture resembles an acute myocardial infarction - breathing difficulties and chest pain appear. The disease was first described in Japan in 1991 and the name Takotsubo comes from a pitcher - a trap for catching octopuses in its shape resembling that of a damaged heart.

The substance also impairs short-term memory - so smoking a joint, e.g. before a university exam, can have fatal consequences for students.

A similar correlation occurs with acetone exhaled,\" said the PAP interlocutor.

In terms of expertise, treatment or prescribed drugs I have absolutely nothing to reproach. Medicines and diagnosis are accurate and the child has recovered relatively quickly. Another issue is the approach to the patient or child. Namely, the approach has no lack of sensitivity and delicacy. It is not difficult to guess that such behaviour towards children results in fear and aversion to any tests. It may be an effect of \"material fatigue\", but in such a situation it may be worth considering giving up treatment to small patients who do not always understand the treatments that take place. Only two asterisks due to the lack of at least minimal empathy towards patients, which in addition to treatment is also important.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

When asked by Dr . Niznikiewicz whether they should take an alternative opinion answers that there is no need to give some kind of \"judgment\".

He has a phenomenal approach to the patient, devotes a lot of attention to preoperative consulates, explaining what the disease is, analyzes in detail the resonance, symptoms, answers all questions. Before he underwent surgery, he also consulted with em in other private clinics in Warsaw, and the decision to give himself into the hands of docent Bronarski was made, among other things, because the patient after the surgery stays for 4-5 days in the hospital and is under the strict control of the docent.

The Dicer gene cannot be switched off in zygotes, because it will prevent the proper development of embryos. However, scientists have developed a way to cut out a specific gene from the genome of a suitably genetically modified adult mouse using pharmacological means. \"The first mice in which the Dicer gene could be switched off at any time were given 'em a few years ago during a postdoctoral internship at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.

Apart from the fact that the hotel should not have 4 * because, for example, the place where you eat your meals should be called a canteen and not a restaurant (in hotels of the chain sol are beautiful restaurants in Bulgaria) then the team of animators deserves special attention. Although the hotel provides animation activities for children, including evening mini disco, the animators did not carry out this program, i.e. they carried out the program formally.

Thus, in persons with autoimmune diseases, the presence of intestinal nematodes in the body results in the inhibition of an excessive inflammatory reaction and, as a consequence, the symptoms of diseases such as non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases and even multiple sclerosis (MS). Our experiments were aimed at indicating the mechanisms that are induced during treatment with live nematodes in mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis - the SM model. During the experiments we identified a new population of leukocytes, the number of which increases significantly during remission of the disease in mice infected with nematodes\" - explained Dr Donskow - \u0141ysoniewska . Further studies have shown that it is possible to activate and increase the number of such leukocytes not only in vivo, but also ex vivo, in blood taken from diseased mice. \"The discovered mechanism is very likely to work for other autoimmune diseases as well, as it may be universal. We are about to start experiments on mice affected by Alzheimer's disease\" - adds Dr Donskow - Lysonskaya.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:I will give a neutral assessment, because the doctor has both advantages and disadvantages, more or less at a similar level.

I was in his ward for rehabilitation (I was already after spinal surgery, but Dr. Lukaniec was not my attending physician). As a \"stranger\" I felt very bad, I simply cried out of nervousness after every round in the rehabilitation ward, and later on the rehabilitation exercises the women had to calm me down. He was making various attachments to me just because I wasn't his patient and he said that I shouldn't be in his rehabilitation ward, but I should go to Warsaw at the Medical Academy Clinic - the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Clinic on Lindley Street in Warsaw and let them rehabilitate me there, it didn't seem to be a good idea to explain that there is no rehabilitation ward and there are no rehabilitants in the clinic. Additionally, the doctor made jokes about the doctor who operated on me and as for me it is rude. In medicine it is not only medical knowledge that counts, but also the approach to the patient is important.

A characteristic feature of this disease is that it progresses at a constant pace. The effect of SLA is, among other things, the loss of muscle strength in the hands of the patients, which makes them less independent (they cannot e.g. lift a cup by themselves). Doctors from Olsztyn, who administer stem cells to SLA patients as part of scientific research, have not yet had tools which would objectively indicate whether the muscle strength in the hands of their patients remains constant or weakens (there is no biological marker which would indicate it - PAP). \"The feelings of patients or their loved ones in this respect were not reliable, they often depended on the patient's mood on a given day\" - admitted neurologist Tomasz Siwek, who is a member of the team investigating the influence of stem cells on SLA slowing down, in an interview with PAP.

In the next stage, the second wing will be created as a \"mirror image\".\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The hotel is relatively well located in relation to the city center (can be reached on foot in 10 - 15 minutes), in the vicinity of the hotel there is only a gas station. When entering the hotel you may be mistaken and enter a guarded private car park (the first barrier on the right), but I recommend to do it because a day there costs 18 PLN while in the hotel guarded car park 50 PLN and 20 PLN on unguarded. The standard room that we received was medium sized, well equipped (minibar, safe, extra blanket, tea/coffee set, extra pillows) unfortunately, quite long and until we asked for refreshment, sometimes dirty walls, literally black curtains, wiped old carpet, old TV set. The bathrooms are small, fairly clean, fluffy, fresh towels, spoiled effect cracked tiles in the shower. Really very comfortable beds you can get a great night's sleep, although there is a bit of noise from a busy crossroads, but in the end it's the city centre. The hotel staff at both the reception and the breakfast room are friendly, courteous and helpful. Breakfast is very good, fresh products and a large selection of dishes, only scrambled eggs were missing. The hotel clearly needs money to renovate and then it would be a great 4 star hotel. Nowadays it's pretty good as a stopover although I think the competition, has rooms of much better quality at a similar price.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

The service is nice and helpful, the rooms are clean but a bit tight. Mattresses (in a room with two beds) hard and a bit too narrow. The room has a quasi-bathroom consisting of a washbasin and a shower (which you enter directly from the room) and a separate room with a toilet, which in my opinion is too spacious, which makes an unpleasant impression; the lack of glaze in this place makes all odors enter the wallpaper located on the walls. Heating in the winter season by means of air conditioning, which can cause excessive air drying. Overall hotel rating: average. The purchase was encouraged by a price much lower than the standard one and this was the only advantage of this facility. The hotel can be an alternative to the hostel offer.",

Hotel located in a poor location if someone wants to explore the island . To the biggest attractions 1, 5 - 2h drive. The service is poor, English only knows the staff at the reception, the restaurant could not get along. Cleaning service on a mediocre level. During the whole stay, not once were refilled containers with shampoo / wash gel, for 3 days was not refilled toilet paper. Not once was the floor vacuumed / swept / washed. Cleaning came down to changing towels and emptying baskets. When it comes to hotel equipment, all the years of glory is long gone. Squalid pools, children's playground is 1 big rocker, 1 slide and 2 rockers. The worst downside of this hotel is the total focus on the French-speaking customer. The 95% of the animations took place in this language, which is why the French people were having fun, and the rest of the nation (Polish, Slovak, German, English) watched and did not know what was happening. Such an attitude and behaviour is, in my opinion, shameful and should not happen.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:She chose this place for the fall weekend. The hotel is very nice and well maintained.

The food is very good, the breakfast is varied and the dinner is fresh and nicely served. The surroundings of the hotel is a park with benches (we did not manage to pass it because of other attractions that we had planned). The spa is not \"grazed\" in terms of room climate and decor, but those who carry out treatments know their stuff. After the massage you can really relax.

Hotel itself OK - a lot of attractions for children, swimming pool, animation, playgrounds, etc .

Fortunately, I was then under the proper care of Dr. Urban, who quickly applied the correct treatment, first the arthroscopy, then he had to work on removing the attachments after the surgery, which the doctor applied to me after my first injury, applied bone rubble to fill the hole after the said attachment, and finally reconstructed my ligament with a graft. Dr. Urban has performed a total of 3 treatments on my knee and I know that I got my hands on it, more than 2 years have passed since the last treatment and I can still enjoy playing soccer thanks to this doctor.

I know that the shower heads are now fashionable, but this one worked so badly that it was difficult to wash. Although I traveled alone, the room where I slept had two single beds.

It is not excluded that the group of hotels could increase by another several hundred facilities from the current group of \"other accommodation facilities\" if the rigid formal requirements were abandoned and the barrier between these facilities and hotels was lowered. Then some of the owners would certainly not skimp on the money for modernization of their facilities, after which they would subject them to categorization. Simplification of the rules of categorisation of accommodation facilities in Poland and its unification, e.g. with the classification of Hotelstars Union currently used in 15 EU countries, could have another effect: it could help to increase the number of foreigners staying in facilities not belonging to global chains.",

So she signed up for a visit to Dr. Bystrzejewski suggesting herself with opinions on the internet. I can now say that all my appointments were made in a hurry because every time there was a delay of at least one hour because the doctor was always late. Such a situation should not happen, taking into account that each visit must be properly paid for. During the whole pregnancy I had about 13 visits after which the doctor did not even remember my name. With a clear conscience I can say that the sympathetic doctor conducted the examination in a gentle manner. Unfortunately, the visits lasted a few minutes in total, the doctor forgot to write prescriptions because he was in an eternal rush. The worst thing is that with this hurry and distraction, the doctor had to interpret the results of the examination which could result in damage to the fetus. When after my overzealousness finally came out that the results are bad and it is because of the doctor's inattention, she did not even hear me apologize.

Several situations during my pregnancy have confirmed that this is an exceptional doctor, one that is unlikely to be found in our health service. I will certainly be able to lead a second pregnancy with your doctor.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Some time ago I overloaded my shoulder and reported to the Doctor - he found a rupture of the rotator cone muscles and although the diagnosis in the ultrasound did not confirm it completely, at least partly yes: tightness syndrome. In an e-mail contact the doctor did not answer precisely the questions I asked and quite generally he said that the nature of the ailment is transient and everything can be done with the shoulder, but I do not know if all these are everyday activities or more advanced, such as exercises with the burden on the body. It is time that will show the thought . For now, a neutral commentary .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The Doctor's very nice. It was my first visit chosen thanks to the opinions of a well-known doctor.pl I was not disappointed. I was very sympathetic to the patient, I explained every doubt and perceived the problem broadly, i.e. not only gynaecologically, but also endocrinologically. During the visit, I did not feel embarrassed at all, there were no unnecessary questions, only specifics. And at the same time, the visit in relation to other specialists at an attractive price. I recommend it with a clear conscience. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Unfortunately, the next time I visited in March, I was very disappointed, because I was after the procedure and the doctor did a review in 2 minutes without saying anything.

I understand that there was a delay in appointments of more than 15 minutes but the patient pays and wants to be served properly. Unfortunately, as I had a good opinion at first, so after the next visit has changed. In addition, the Doctor claimed that I don't have erosions and the doctors at the hospital said that I have very extensive, so I guess it's probably the Doctor's whole rush that makes a lot of things go unnoticed.

The downside is certainly the lack of air conditioning, which in this year's hot weather causes great discomfort, especially if the room is on the 6th floor.

He's a spray-headed, unpleasant, not very competent. I am in the fourth month of pregnancy, and the doctor for diarrhea ordered me to take 20 charcoal tablets at a time, for a cold he ordered me to drink as he expressed it with lime tree septica. When she asked me to be released with indignation, he answered so that she wouldn't go to work because pregnancy is not a disease.

After the first visit, I can say that he is a very nice man, calm, helpful and helpful in explaining things he was not asked about. I won't give you an evaluation because he hasn't used his help with any problems so far; he just asked me for a prescription for the medicines I have to take. It's interesting that it turned out that he can prescribe much more than I was told before, to make it last longer - that's what made 'em very happy. I think the pharmacists in the pharmacy were also very happy that they didn't have to guess what the doctor prescribed me - he wrote the prescription on the computer and printed it out.

However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side. Once again, I am very sympathetic to you and wish you good luck, as well as read the reading and proper preparation for your next pregnancy.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Competent , devotes as much time as necessary to the patient without looking at the watch , performs the service at the price of the visit .

Dr. Karachun couldn't explain why the disease came back (supposedly he never had such a case) and recommended ... further rehabilitation. After another month of exercise there was no improvement and we decided to seek help elsewhere.

In fact, it was visible (it was enough to make the child stand up straight). We found out that without a cure of the right knee there is no chance to recover the left one. The new rehabilitation (once a week), which focused mainly on stretching the right knee and generally the whole body, removed the injury very quickly. We made an \"oral complaint\" to Dr. Karachun asking for reimbursement of the costs of the failed treatment. They told us about the course of the new rehabilitation and the reason why the disease came back. He did not agree with this opinion. He stated that the contraction of one knee has absolutely no effect on the condition of the other. They asked us to write this statement on a piece of paper - unfortunately he refused.

Dr. Karachun only removed the effect of our son's left knee disease, so she came back.

The hotel is located in a very quiet area, but this is what she was looking for. It consists of one-storey and one-storey bungalows. The rooms are comfortable, spacious, plus a mosquito net in the window because there are mosquitoes. The service is very polite, there is even a very nice waitress from Poland Aneta and bartender Mateusz. The whole staff is very nice. The hotel area is well maintained, lots of greenery and clean. Sandy beach, great, that there is no bar and noise of music there, because I'm looking for such intimate places. Access to the beach about 300 meters. animation I do not judge, because we do not use and best as if they were not at all. Something was going on, but they didn't make a lot of noise. Medium food. I missed water in bottles and tea for dinner and supper. The drinks from the dispensers are mega-cold and tasteless. I ended up buying me water and carrying it to the canteen with the all option. There is no shower by the pool, so people jump into the water, greased with creams and the water is completely cloudy. On the left side of the horizon you can see two electron chimneys, which unfortunately smoke. There is no smell of smoke, but it interferes with the wonderful view of the sea! ! !

From the very beginning there are problems with the door, and exactly with the card (reported several times but without an echo).

The price is 140 PLN a day, breakfast 20 PLN / person additionally paid on request. I think it's a good option if not all people use breakfast. Breakfast is a choice of sets with a hot dish and extras in large quantities. We have been given a spacious room a la suite (folded with 2 rooms with balcony). In the bedroom there is a large, comfortable bed for married couples, really comfortable pillows, a little too thin a cushion. The bathroom was spacious, well lit, but the downside was a bathtub without a curtain. You had to be very careful when using the shower to avoid flooding the bathroom. The bedroom was a bit chilly. Plus a small fridge in the room. Very important for business travellers is the location in the centre, close to offices and institutions - on foot in a few minutes. On the 3rd floor we did not hear the city noise. Proximity to restaurants, shops, caf\u00e9s, services, bus stops, also a few minutes on foot. The wind - the fi worked fine - we only used laptops. Very nice service at the reception and at breakfast. Very small car park at the back of the hotel, lockable. In front of the hotel there are many parking spaces available. For us the price / quality / location / location / service / cleaning as much as possible. We stayed earlier in an ordinary motel in Nysa without wi - fi, breakfast, or the possibility of drinking coffee in an uninteresting and loud location at a price of 120zl / day so comparing the conditions here with this motel pays off more hereThe better conditions for an additional 20zl more.

I was very surprised because every patient who reports pain and inflammation should be treated in such a way as to eliminate the pain and inflammation in the first place. She asked me for medication and pain relief with medication. For this Dr. Hebda repeated twice more that she could only do me a painful rectoscopy and not on the day of my visit, but after a special preparation in two days. She didn't give up on me and started asking me what I should do in that case. She recommended me to see a proctologist in her private office, not necessarily at her. She asked me for the doctor's card and made an appointment to visit her office the same day. She asked me again about the pain relief and only then did she get me the right clue. Maybe she would have gone to me for this visit but the amount of 200 PLN . a few years ago was unacceptable for me . Besides, I did not like how she treated me.

Well, he expected me to have specific information about what is the cause of the pain. Now all I know is that it probably happened by doing too much exercise and the result is pain. Still, however, I have no idea \"what\" really happened and how I can avoid it in the future. I have had similar problems in the past and now I have returned to training with great caution, paying attention to the correct technique and trying to increase weights slowly enough.

P . : Children's skin is built just like adults', but their immune system is not developed enough to react quickly and efficiently to external factors, so they are less protected also from the sun. When children are at the water, they often play by the shore, and that is where it is easiest to get burned. Water drops on the skin act as a lens - they concentrate the radiation. On foreign beaches we can see children by the water in T-shirts and shorts. This is reasonable, because even if they get wet, staying in wet clothes in the hot sun will not harm them, and even cools them, while protecting them from the sun. There are already clothes for children with sunscreens available on the market. It is also necessary to remember about more frequent relubrication, because while playing in the sand children can wipe off the cream. It should also be remembered that while in water we also sunbathe - up to 2.5 m deep the radiation is the same as on land.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Linear Algebra 1 ( for AiR on Eka ) I recommend for easy courses.

Sometimes there are tasks in which the basic problem is the neck-breaking calculation (because the data were chosen as if for anger), and in the evaluation of the task you pay attention almost only to the result . At the same time, there is no need to dream about stretching a point from a tested colloquium.

The playground is beautiful in the pictures and completely not functional because it is located all day long in the sun without a canopy and so no one uses it unless after dark. I confirm that the roosters are drinking not mercifully confirm that the food is monotonous, tasteless 3 species and any cheap products. If the breakfasts, let's say, were quite enough to swallow, then after 3 days the dinners went out sideways - it's better to eat out. Rooms are badly cleaned, cursory by not very nice cleaners who even invite guests out of the room and clean as it is comfortable for them and not for guests. The main building is the showcase of the hotel and so it is beautiful and mega clean. In the rooms are old beds with mega hard mattresses you can literally spend a few sleepless nights. The hotel's total sum is not worth the price and if it wasn't for the cute waiters who made up for the rest, you could say that the staff was also hopeless - especially the reception.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Being in several hotels abroad I think we have to boast about what we have in Poland, and this hotel deserves praise. Yes, the fact is a colossus, maybe the room equipment could be better but the food and aquapark is at the highest world level. Such food as in Go\u0142\u0119biewski in Miko\u0142ajki I did not eat either in Paris or Greece, or in Bulgaria or Turkey. The point is not that there were 'em in not knowing what hotels but that the food in Go\u0142\u0119biewski is really at the extra level. I know that some people will probably be surprised what he writes - but I like to eat and like here I will not eat anywhere. And a swimming pool like they have in Mikolajki in the basement of the hotel is really first class . we are there again in winter and we are very impressed . What you've eaten burns down in the pools and the hours pass so quickly that you regret leaving.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:I wanted to register yesterday in 4WSK to Dr. Gavr\u00edsia , but I was told that the enrolment for the second quarter will only be in February, and the first one is no longer available. Could someone kindly who treated himself in 4WSK to Dr. Gavr\u00ed\u015b answer me how this quarterly registration looks like? Do you have to come on the first day of registration and stand in line, e.g. at 4 am because there will be no more places later? You hear various things about registering to good specialists and so far I have not had the pleasure because I was not sick. . . Besides, I have a question whether if I get an appointment and get treated, will I have to wait for the next one for 3 months again or will the doctor himself set me a deadline? And is such a quarterly way of registering for specialists as in Weigel's case rather the norm or does it look different in other institutions (with NFZ agreement)?

So she went to the clinic and just got me a doctor. I have to say that she was pleasantly surprised by me because this time there was an interview, she was sent to me for additional examinations and it looked like the doctor was worried. Nevertheless, the examination was very painful what the doctor dskonale saw but still did it. However, after the prescribed medication she recovered completely. The third and last one was a check-up visit which the doctor asked me if I was already healthy and said yes and I was not examined anymore. To sum up, the doctor is a great specialist, although he is not always gentle, but for the price of recovery, at least in my case I may have suffered a lot. Sometimes he's in a hurry and has a sense of humour. In general there is a tendency in most patients that they either like him or he has made a negative impression on them and they don't come to him anymore and from here, in my opinion, negative comments.

As you can see, it was a mistake.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:A doctor with a true vocation, forgiving and patient, friendly to the patient, very competent, not afraid only to explain everything calmly. He thoroughly and attentively interviewed Mom about her illness and the treatment she has received so far, he got acquainted with the results and presented his diagnosis and plan for further treatment. My Mom has been treated for many years for diabetes, the disease has intensified recently and it was necessary to turn on insulin. The doctor who has been treating Mom so far has not been able to convince her to insulin, which has had a very negative effect on her health, the sugars have gone crazy, and also sensory neuropathy has appeared, and consequently problems with the diabetic foot have started. As a result, Mom took very large amounts of medication and regularly had to go to the surgical clinic to change the dressing. The cost of treatment increased, the health condition deteriorated and the wound did not heal. . And when I was already broken down and lost hope, an acquaintance at the diabetes clinic recommended me to Dr. Ch\u0119ci\u0144ski. After the visit at your doctor's place, my mother convinced herself to insulin! After such a long time, after hundreds of conversations, no one was able to convince Mom to insulin, and one visit to doctor Ch\u00eaci\u00f1ski was enough. Sugars have normalized, Mom feels much better, diabetic foot looks better and better and heals very quickly thanks to Doctor's recommendations. Mom and I are very grateful to the doctor for his help and involvement in our case.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Some time ago I overloaded my shoulder and reported to the Doctor - he found a rupture of the rotator cone muscles and although the diagnosis in the ultrasound did not confirm it completely, at least partly yes: tightness syndrome. In an e-mail contact the doctor did not answer precisely the questions I asked and quite generally he said that the nature of the ailment is transient and everything can be done with the shoulder, but I do not know if all these are everyday activities or more advanced, such as exercises with the burden on the body. It is time that will show the thought . For now, a neutral commentary .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:During the first visit she made a nice impression on me, she has a different approach to the patient than other doctors. She is interested in the patient's lifestyle (e.g. how she eats, smokes, etc.) and this is good because many gynaecological diseases are caused by the poor condition of the whole body. Her methods of treatment are long-term, she does not write down \"aggressive\" drugs. I have vaginal inflammation which I have been treating with Mrs. Agrawal for quite a long time and decided to finally go to another gynaecologist. It is possible that I am not consistent enough in Mrs. Agrawal's natural methods and I cannot fully cure myself. It is like with other diseases, you can fight them by increasing the immunity of the whole body but sometimes the disease is so strong that there is no other method of treatment except \"aggressive\" therapy (e.g. antibiotics). I recommend Mrs. Agrawal to all women who want to be more aware of their body, but at the same time it is worthwhile to use the help of a more \"traditional\" gynaecologist (I do so).\nAnswer:ambivalent",

The hotel is a very good place to get to the hotel, but it is not easy to get to the hotel alone, you have to go off the asphalt road to a dirt road that leads through a lot of unevenness. The hotel itself is located in a beautiful area between two lakes, so those who like contact with nature will not be disappointed. Checking in at the hotel's reception went smoothly, we reached the room by the stairs located next to the reception. Since they were traveling with two children, they chose a two-storey family room. However, the room was not well cleaned (on the carpet chips, a cobweb in the corners of the wall, a broken liquid feeder for bathing in the shower, under the shower a stone visible to the naked eye, the gasket at the bottom of the shower was clearly not replaced since the dawn because it had already had a yellow air raid, no light bulb in the ceiling lamp) In addition, the room had a stove because it was quite cool but despite the fact that it was on all the time, the temperature in the room was not high enough. Despite reporting defects in the room at the reception, these defects were not removed and we were not proposed to change the room. However, we received a set of soaps and bathing liquids. Ned long after check-in we used the swimming pool area, unfortunately, and here disappointment because the water in the pool was cold (it certainly had a lot below the ottoman's level of 28 degrees), dry sauna instead of having 90 degrees had only 49 degrees and despite an attempt to raise the temperature with the controller unfortunately we did not succeed. After leaving the helm of the swimming pools, the children wanted to play the game, however, from the hill on only a partial lighting of the tracks and the hall, the game was possible, but it was no longer so much fun. After reporting all the faults and our general dissatisfaction with the ponytu and after deciding to resign from the stay (because of the children) we received information that we can leave the hotel but no costs will be refunded. I am the Deputy Reception Manager of the 3-star hotel in Warsaw and I am surprised that even a partial refund was not possible. In my opinion, this is quite an unprofessional approach on the part of the facility management. The advantages of the stay include simple but tasty food for both obioado - dinner and breakfast.

But it didn't bother us at all, because we spent little time in it and it didn't affect the use of it at all, because all the necessary aspects (bathroom, air-conditioning, comfortable beds) were flawless. At this stage it is a hotel for people who do not mind the lack of lighting on the balcony or the choice of \"only\" two kinds of meat during meals. We are very pleased with the stay in this hotel and Albania, in itself, is so rich in culture, history and landscape that it is worth visiting it.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:As he says, our little tenants help us to digest e.g. fat, protein, fibre or sugars. He adds that substances secreted by bacteria can e.g. change the action of e.g. digestive enzymes or bile, and it is very important in absorbing fats or vitamins contained in them. The set of genes of our small tenants (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites) are microbial. It is easy enough for a microbiome to be examined by analyzing a faecal sample and sequencing the genes contained therein. Each of us has a slightly different microbiome that works a little differently. This, among other things, makes it easy for some people to gain weight in addition to our own genes, and for others to make concessions in their diet.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:In fact, Mr. Dr. Dr. Dr. is very thorough for a small amount, he is quite nice and eager to help. The downside to this is that during my visit, Mr. Dr. Dr. was doing private things over the phone and could not advise me on the cure, she heard me say that it was only my decision. However, I think he should know better what is better for me. This does not change the fact that he is one of the few gynaecologists who remembers the breast examination and stresses its importance, which is extremely important.\nAnswer:ambivalent",
    "input": "The hotel itself is a decent hotel, by far the biggest advantage are the people - the whole service without any problems. The food is fine, it's just a shame that all three breakfasts were exactly the same. The biggest obstacle was the extremely poor internet connection in the room (2nd floor in the MSPA building) - to the extent that normal browser work was not possible. After moving to the bar area it was no problem. The area with a very warm swimming pool, the water alone is not quite so much, maybe that is why the pool is generally empty, so it was nice to swim. The only downside is that the geysers and water whips work automatically (you can't turn them on and off by yourself), so if nobody wants to use them, they still pour with full force and make swimming more difficult (the pool is not wide, so there are waves from the whips and half the pool is not for floating use, because the whips are pouring). The lying down is very pleasant and warm around. Although we were without a child, you can see that the infrastructure and the whole hotel is child friendly: )",

Both human and parasite cells need folic acid to grow. Interestingly, blocking the so-called folic acid pathway is one of the mechanisms of action of currently used anti-cancer drugs such as methotrexate. Instead of creating brand new anti-cancer drugs, recently, consideration has been given to optimizing existing drugs to block the folic acid pathway of these parasites. This approach gives a chance to speed up the process of drug development\" - says Dr Panecka . He points out, however, that the metabolism of the pheasants is different from that of humans. The protein called PTR1 makes the parasites resistant to drugs such as methotrexate. Scientists have tried to inhibit the activity of this protein, but there is still a lack of knowledge to do it effectively. It is not known, among other things, how different parts of the protein molecule move in relation to each other. Dynamics is very important for the function of enzymes such as PTR1 .

Namely, after quite a short time all unused wipes in the box dry out. Maybe it's my fault that I didn't properly store 'em box but it certainly didn't lie in a warm place.

    "input": "Nice design, intuitive operation, touch panel working efficiently. A very good idea is the possibility of mounting the power supply with a relay at the stove and the panel itself on the wall - so you do not have to think about where to hide the power supply. Now the downside: the temperature sensor protrudes outside the housing. I suppose that this is not how it was supposed to look in the original design. When wiping the dust this sensor can be damaged . Another thing is calibration . Measurement at first connection is 4 degrees apart, it is too much. I understand the degree or half but not 4 . Another drawback is the loud operation of the inverter inside the panel and the annoying buzzing of the panel which can be heard at night - even with the display switched off. The last downside is that you can't turn off the panel clicking when you press , which when you try to change the temperature at night acts like an alarm clock for the person sleeping next to you. Anyway, a cool product.",

Earlier she called me at the hospital and wanted me to make an appointment for a consultation, but the waiting time was too long, especially since she had a suspected pituitary tumor. That's why she decided to pay me a private visit to the Chief Executive. She looked at the results very quickly and said that from next week on I could come to the hospital for a two-week examination. I had a couple of tests done at the hospital and instead of focusing on my real problem, the Chief Executive started telling me that I had anorexia, without a prior interview and without any tests. When I first left the hospital, I had no hope of ever getting pregnant. The Chief Executive said that I am infertile and that I can say goodbye to the children. Besides, according to Dr. Tuchendler, I have a secondary functional hyperprolactinemia. I didn't get an MRI, but it was found that I don't have a tumor. Besides, of course the Chief Executive insisted on anorexia. The first time I ended up giving me a norepinephrine and she was supposed to report me after six months. The second time she got me to the hospital after 6 months. Before that, however, she reported me to Dr. Boche\u0144ska (one of the best therapists when it comes to food problems) who, after talking to me, said that there is nothing to fear and I have no symptoms of anorexia. In the hospital I had a series of tests, unfortunately without an MRI. The prolactin was still above the norm, while the headmaster at the discharge prescribed me steroids (she said not to read the leaflet because I might be scared), some kind of appetite agent (in connection with my alleged anorexia) and still taking norprolactin (as it turned out later, it should not be taken longer than six months). After two weeks in hospital and such a diagnosis, my patience and understanding for Mrs. Tuchendler ended. She changed my doctor to Dr. Szymczak, who ruled out steroids (they were to work on my adrenal glands, which I have healthy), prescribing me only progesterone. What can defend my statement . . . maybe it is that after 3 months Mrs. Szymczak got me pregnant, and for the last two months I am a mother of a healthy, big and beautiful daughter. I sincerely discourage Dr. Tuchendler as a specialist and a man ( cold, unpleasant ) . Maybe she is disappointed with her daddy's previous military career. . .",

The place is ideally located to have a large number of hungry guests, coming down from the mountains or going down the gondola train. The climate is nice, although the idyllic highlander decor should be cleaned from time to time from the omnipresent dust. . . We have been waiting for the card for a while. . . It is interestingly written, although the catchy names of the dishes do not explain what is inside. For example, under the name of a meat pan there is a greasy sausage 1 piece. and grilled black pudding 1 piece. In addition to this there is a handful of frozen vegetables, a piece of bread roll, one hot potato in uniform divided in half and a non-eatable garlic sauce. Price. . . attention: 29 z\u0142 ! ! ! ! For four people, two have already eaten before the next two are served dinner. . . the famous sausage and a portion of old Russian dumplings, heated up in hot oil, from which, when cut, it came out. . . . . . . . Brrrrrrrr. . . . . . Drama. The charm was complemented by the Manager / Owner, who was taking advantage of the waitress who could not cope with the terminal - by the guests! Massacre, never again. It's better to approach Karpacz, where in the net, your smiling ladies will bake a piece of real meat. At half price . Plus for \u017burek in oven-baked bread . In the card stands that with egg and sausage . There were only pieces of sausage . Eggs nobody saw but a good snorkel. Please avoid the White Jar with the \"Johnny delicacies\" wide arch!\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Location : definitely by car : ) although it is close to everywhere anyway. The only downside is the construction site outside the window, but it's not the hotel's fault. Rooms: all clean, renovated, fragrant. Kitchenette in the room which can be used despite the restaurant serving meals. Food: we only had breakfast included in the price in the form of a Swedish buffet of course. Large choice, nice service, tasty: ) The price is as good as possible. I recommend ! : )\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Today, customers, that is our guests, are looking for something different than what is everywhere. What do you offer different? We try to be different than everyone else. Our resort is founded on a SPA plus hotel. As a rule, the SPA is an addition to the hotel, with us it is the opposite. SPA is the basis of a wide range of wellness, massages, oriental rituals and a set of specialized, high quality cosmetic services. And what fits under the term wellness we also have, of course, that is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, saunas, baths, salt cave. Do you know a facility in the Podkarpacie region, which offers a similar range of services? There is no such . Maybe Ar\u0142am\u00f3w will have a similar offer, but we have a different scale of the facility. In May we'll have 40 rooms on 10 hectares, not 250. We offer intimacy, intimacy and the highest comfort.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:We have been thinking about the purchase for a long time, because the price is not low, but we are satisfied with the pram and the baby likes to walk since he can see the world around him. The stroller is light, the wheels are doing well on our holes, although sometimes you have to make up your mind with the guidance, but it's the fault of the roads, not the stroller. The seat translates easily and quickly, remember the center of gravity when you take it out with your child! ! ! It's a pity that manufacturers of strollers make them for mums, not children - it's about the possibility of moving the handle or the seat - after all, a child can blow in the face or blast the sun! ! ! ! How can you oil it? ! Dear producers, the trolley is not an addition to a fashionable mother, but something much more important! ! ! Nice colours and the possibility of unfolding the seat are also advantages. Disadvantages, apart from the price? Due to the condition of our roads, gravel, sand and dirt, the foam wheels quickly show signs of wear. The shed could be a bit longer, the winter low sun shines in the child's eyes. The light in the shelter could be covered, a piece of material and a zipper would be enough: o) I'm a little short of a pocket in the stroller, but it's a matter of habit: o) Oh, a shopping basket is great! ! ! Generally, a nice shopping cart!\nAnswer:ambivalent",
    "input": "Well done and stable. We have been using for a year and we are satisfied . The only significant drawback is the way we move around the room with this chair. Because it only has wheels at the back, to move it, you have to lift the front part, there is only one problem - there is no need to grab it. All the parts are quite strong, but even with a slight lift (and even more so with the child inside), you bend the parts you grab and feel like something is about to break. In the show film there is a fictional way of moving, because in such a bend you can break your spine :) . It is often the case that you only need to slightly change the position of the chair or move it to the table with your child and every time you have a big problem with it. The best thing to do would be to attach the strap to the lower part of the front legs and then a small lift would allow you to move it. Besides, everything is ok. Maybe two such lightweight covers on the backrest would also be useful, because it is made of leatherette and the child lying on it sweats immediately - so easy washability is also not entirely true, because you always have to put something under the child's bottom, back and head so that it does not sweat. In general I think it is good, I have a comparison with another seat and this one is much better.",

I ride them for the second season and I have to say that these tires are one big failure. As long as there is no snow it is ok but a bit of snow is enough and we already have problems with starting and most importantly with braking - in typical winter conditions (snow on the roads) driving at a speed of more than 50 km / h is suicidal.

That is why I strongly advise against buying these tires, for example Debica or Kormoran are much better and the price is similar. . .\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Oh I see that most of the visitors to this forum are pouring out frustrations that I don't understand. I'm just starting my \"adventure\" with the device and for now she started to treat me so that I could wear the device at all and that's why she looked at the forum but for now I judge her as a good professional. She's already been to many doctors and I'm glad that someone recommended her to me because she finally found a dentist who does his or her job and does it well. I think that the value for money is balanced. Sure, she could be nicer but I don't care. Actually, this is the first debitant I can accuse of being a dry person, and I really was already in the clinics where it was nice and before the anesthesia I was given strawberry anesthetic gel to make sure the injection wouldn't hurt, but so what if they treated my tooth root canal in the dentical center in question, then they made lace (the cost of the whole treatment was 2500, of course the person accepting the payment had a big smile on their lips and everyone was melting away in courtesy). Now it turned out that there was a perforation of the canal while inserting the attachment to the lace and now I have a huge cyst and I am in danger of paralysis of the bark nerve. . . . . .of course she heard m that it was not their fault. Another dentist, while putting the seal on, crushed a field of my tooth because she missed the drill and heard that it was my tooth's fault and I had to make the crown. . . . However, so far Mackiewicz has cured 3 of my teeth and she hasn't broken anything, so I'm very happy and she paid me less than she paid me so far, so it doesn't bother me that it hurt a little more. She always agreed to wait for the evening hours and she waited for 30 minutes max, if you wait as you always say for more than 2 hours then maybe you should leave the house later, besides waiting in lines is really small problem considering that in return you can have your teeth cured properly. The fact that in larger surgeries hasn't really waited at all, but what if I have to treat what they have done to my mouth or a massacre. In my opinion, Mackiewicz is simply concrete and that's why it may not seem nice. I think that despite these negative entries I will decide to have her braces (and I will share my experience later), because the arguments that you have to wait or that she is arrogant are not very substantive and so far she has gained my trust because she simply cured my teeth, that's all that I have to save from the dentist.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Apart from really big hotels, where an employee dedicated to public relations has something to do every day, in most of the facilities there is no need for such employment.

In the price of the stay, guests get daily 2-hour entry to the pool next door, which also pleasantly surprised us.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:I wanted to register yesterday in 4WSK to Dr. Gavr\u00edsia , but I was told that the enrolment for the second quarter will only be in February, and the first one is no longer available. Could someone kindly who treated himself in 4WSK to Dr. Gavr\u00ed\u015b answer me how this quarterly registration looks like? Do you have to come on the first day of registration and stand in line, e.g. at 4 am because there will be no more places later? You hear various things about registering to good specialists and so far I have not had the pleasure because I was not sick. . . Besides, I have a question whether if I get an appointment and get treated, will I have to wait for the next one for 3 months again or will the doctor himself set me a deadline? And is such a quarterly way of registering for specialists as in Weigel's case rather the norm or does it look different in other institutions (with NFZ agreement)? Thank you in advance for your answer. I think it will also be useful for others who are not familiar with it. . . Greetings\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in December. We were there with a trip abroad. In many rooms it was just cold, we had to ask for blankets or extra heaters. The rooms in the hotel were fine, although they were not crazy. Breakfast in total tasty, large, standard choice. The staff tried to do their best, although sometimes they were misleading (it was a form of payment for the stay) and had to repeat two or three times what it was about. The hotel has no parking and the bus had to stand very far away. The advantage is undoubtedly the location in the very centre. I do not know if it deserves 3 stars .\nAnswer:ambivalent",

Very quickly organized a table for 8 people, immediately reported the baby feeding chair, asked the children how they liked Wroclaw, and so on. At one point my 7 year old daughter asked if there is ketchup on what you smile: sure it is, I'm going to bring it to you. A few words and gestures and it is impressive.",

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:Unfortunately, I don't have good memories with this doctor. As a teenager, she stretched my ligament, came to see my older sister, the doctor preferred to flirt with my sister instead of checking my knee. During another visit he found out that I think I have fluid in my knee which he has to pull away, when he was sticking a thick needle between my bones it hurt a lot, he said that such a big girl is strange that it hurts me, apparently you think that adults have nothing to hurt, and if it was supposed to be funny it didn't work out. As far as the treatment itself is concerned it somehow survived the m, it's not good, it's not bad, it's just between.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:With my children (10 years old and 2 years old) I actually only go to doctor. I think that she is a great specialist, she does not treat the patient \"from above\", she is nice, factual and well remembers and knows her little patients. She has an excellent attitude towards children and they like her very much. She does not prescribe immediately, sometimes without any sense, an antibiotic, only when it is necessary. A few times I happened to get to another pediatrician, but as a rule I was not satisfied. I'm glad that the doctor is working in my clinic. When he leaves, I'll have trouble choosing another pediatrician. I highly recommend it!\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:I feel very sorry for your loss of the child. However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side. Once again, I am very sympathetic to you and wish you good luck, as well as read the reading and proper preparation for your next pregnancy.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:I went to Mrs. Polakowska because she had very good reviews on this portal. However, not entirely, Mrs. Polakowska met my expectations. First of all, she had to wait 20 minutes because, which is disrespectful to me, she talked on the phone at that time. When she came into my office, she told me that she wanted me to do either a five or two. The doctor said the cavity was 5 and 6. She asked what she would have wanted me to do in such a case, to which she replied that in such a case 5. After about 15 minutes. - 20 min . she got up from the chair and immediately asked me when I could make an appointment to do 6 and 2 . Then she found out to m that 6 was also done to me. It surprised me a little bit because from what I know these are my teeth and not the doctor's, so by her grace she could at least ask if I wanted to do two teeth at the same time and what is important if I am financially prepared for it. She paid me 270 zloty for this service and luckily she had that much with her. I'm curious if she didn't have so much money with me. Apart from my personal uncomfortable feeling, I leave a neutral comment because the teeth themselves have been done well.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

This was not the most important thing then. She bit my teeth on unpleasant comments from the doctor's mouth and believed that he would cure me. He kept ordering me private tests, prescribing medication. It was really a lot. The question is, was it necessary? Well, my dear, it wasn't. I kept getting the same results that she did every 2 max 3 months. She spent more than 400 PLN on drugs. She felt worse and worse. From a \"healthy\" patient, who was m, she was becoming more and more \"ailing\" every month. My psyche started to sit down. The doctor said that I had very bad results. She believed in it and she was making me sick. The medication caused a lot of side effects which made me feel really bad. In the name of wanting to have a child, I was still tired. After the medication, she gained 20 kg of weight during those two years! She woke up to me when the doctor fell asleep on a private visit! She thought to me: how can such a doctor treat me well if he is not aware of what he is writing on the prescription? ! This was my last visit to this doctor. From now on I don't go to doctors in private anymore. She found me a good doctor at NFZ. During the last visit she showed him the results of tests from that period of treatment by Tomasz Milewicz. The doctor said that the results were not bad! ! ! So she came to the conclusion that the doctor made me feel very sick, then I will go to him and pay for the visits. I suspect that this was the tactic of doctor Milewicz. Fortunately now I am older and wiser, so I warn you about this doctor. He didn't help me, but he just hurt and cleaned his wallet.",

Rooms decorated completely tasteless - a combination with entanglement . During a 3-day stay, nobody cleaned or changed towels. Dust in cabinets per centimetre. But the worst thing is that the owners and employees completely do not react to rude and mega loud behavior of guests who spoil the stay of the rest. The peace and quiet, the communion with nature is not possible. Breakfast, medium or rather weak, has nothing to do with slow food cuisine, which is delicious and deserves praise.

With such a view even a 4-star hotel loses. A little bit small and expensive hotel parking. With such room prices the parking should be free of charge for guests.

Such a strategy is used in the case of prostate cancer in men. It can also be used for kidney cancer patients when the tumor does not exceed 3 cm and is not enlarged. The treatment consists mainly in surgical removal of the tumour or the whole kidney. When the tumor is not big, it is enough to cut out part of the kidney.

Every day a large selection of sweets and fruit - children are delighted. The hotel is sensationally located in the center of the village and also close to the beach.

The hotel is cool, however, there are several elements that should be improved. The food in the restaurant is monotonous, very poorly seasoned (waiters do not clean the plates pretend not to see the guests, you have to bring the drinks yourself).

Great food was in the fish restaurant a la carte (glory for the warm sky in the mouth!) . It is a pity that only there we could try the skills of the chef. The rooms were poorly cleaned despite the tip left (dirty mirrors, sand in the shower). High level animations, everyone will find something for themselves. Live music is great.

Outside the area, quiet, with plenty of space and greenery, the resort stopped in the 90s. Small rooms, in the room a washbasin made of old equipment, separated by a k - g plate covered with the cheapest tiles. The rooms have a \"bathroom\" or rather a toilet with a shower. These are so small, stinking rooms that in order to satisfy the physiological need you have to move the old door to the cabin to make room for yourself (with the door closed there is no possibility of bending over). Bathrooms have not been renovated for at least 20 years. In the cabins, mould and fungus in the places after the joints, cracked old tiles . In places of missing tiles sloppy cement holes . Window sills lined with the same tiles as in bathrooms, cracks glued with adhesive tape . In the renovated rooms (as I read in an earlier review) only new beds with new mattresses were inserted. Unfortunately, duvets and pillows remember the ancient times. The so-called apparatus is equipped with two joined beds (newly replaced) one old, not unfolded child's bed and sold as a bed for adults. In the second room, about thirty years of rest: 2 old sunken armchairs and a sofa bed, which collapses, and when unfolded, you have to support as much as possible - I supported the suitcase so that the bed would not fall down. In addition, you sleep to feel all the transverse planks . The rooms are charged the same amount as a normal bed, there was no proposal to reduce or negotiate the price even as an extra bed. I am ashamed of myself that I had to sleep on such stinking madejo beds and still pay for it. In such cases you should have charged only for the food, which was tastefully good as the standard is varied. Dinner is not recommended. Portions as for colonists or in sanatoriums. Facilities adapted and adapted for colonial stays. There is a caf\u00e9 in the building, it is a pity that it is closed.

At the time when the facility hosted a colony was organized. Unfortunately, instead of children, the other hotel guests in one of the buildings were mixed together.

It's just like at a concert - tragedy - a neglected room, broken shower window, falling tiles, not closing the balcony door - nice staff but treating you like Poles. So to the Russians and Germans very kind and to the Poles for a good day. It was enough for me but with the naked eye you can see the differences, as it is in Turkey - location. There is nothing there. A total depression. One stop. To civilization 15 km . For that noise, I totally advise against this hotel.

I've been staying at the hotel, Gronie, for just four days. Negative things will dominate the review. . . The first thing is the appearance of the hotel. At first glance the object does not look bad, however, the deeper into the forest the more mushrooms, so it was also in this case. The hotel is very bland. It is outdated, wordless. So are the rooms. The furniture in the room - old, a TV set the size of a laptop monitor and in addition a discoloured carpet. The only advantages of my suite were the whirlpool bath and its size. Another disadvantage was the scandalous quality of room cleaning. After inviting the \"staff\" to the room in order to clean it turned out that the room was only vacuumed. There were no bed linen, no shoes lying at the door were even moved. It is also worth mentioning the food served. The dishes were typically, \"canteen\" - not suitable for the hotel. The service in the canteen was very good, the ladies bringing the food were very nice. The hotel is located in addition away from the center of Szczyrk. This is good or bad? It depends on the destination. The bad impression is also made by small details such as the lack of efficient billiard sticks (only one not broken stick for 2 tables).\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:We love and respect the Professor.

It can be annoying only for people who are eternally dissatisfied with life or, as someone has written, factory dissatisfied. The visit allayed my doubts and got me answers to all my questions. I was also informed on the visit that during about 2 years of treatment it may change, i.e. additional apparatuses may be used, which means that costs may increase. And the same can be read in the treatment contract . I suggest to those who accuse this woman that she took money from them just read the contract carefully. She didn't decide to treat me in Orthosmile because of the high costs. She said goodbye to them in a very nice atmosphere, took away my documentation and went to the office I can afford.

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:Unfortunately, I cannot give a positive assessment of the Victoria Hotel. The conditions there are similar to those of the 1990s. At first glance, the hotel looks pretty good. It is located at the very beginning of Szklarska Poreba and is about 10 minutes walk to the center. The rooms may have been clean but they didn't go crazy. Breakfast is quite, quite. Maybe it was the same every day, but I think there was something to choose from. Breakfast was served at an hour. 9 : 00 - 10 : 30 but you had to be at the 9 : 00 point to get something. She didn't notice that the food was being added so after 10, there were only leftovers left. As for the service, it was the first time she met the same person in the hotel as a cook, cleaner and receptionist. One gentleman at the reception showed a total lack of professionalism, treating guests as his colleagues forgetting about the principle of \"Our Lord's client\" (he answered questions in a spraying manner). In the price of the room we had the opportunity to use the SPA type: sauna, jacuzzi and massages. As far as the sauna is concerned, we had to report 2 hours beforehand the intention to use it so that it could heat up. Jacuzzi is such a bigger bathtub max . 4-person bathtub with bubbles . Unfortunately, we did not use it often because the water smelled unpleasant: (And the massages were to be performed using some kind of massage bed, but unfortunately, during the whole stay the bed was the FULL TIME OF SUSTAINABLE! ! ! The hotel has a billiard room, but in order to play you would probably have to have your own poles because these hotel poles are not suitable for anything and certainly not for playing.

The service at the highest level, friendly, helpful, smiling and professional. Easy access to the hotel from the underground car park. The hotel is located 2 minutes from Piotrkowska Street, in the very centre of the city. The only inconvenience is the road works carried out in Lodz, which are not inconvenient for hotel guests (tight, well soundproofed windows). The big advantage is that you can tilt the window and let some fresh air in: ) The only reservations you can have for breakfast. As in all Novotels very unsavoury scrambled eggs, a small selection of cold cuts (there were no chicken cuts at all), a small selection of cheeses (2 yellow, no e.g. mouldy), at 10:00 a.m. the restaurant was short of bread (buns), although breakfasts on Sunday are served until 11:00 a.m. The bread was supplemented at our request. Small portions of a'la carte restaurant dishes, although very tasty. From the hotel 4 * required to have more rich breakfasts and restaurant meals. Internet access very fast, easy to use.

The hotel has 55 double rooms, three conference rooms, which can accommodate up to 140 people after connection. The hotel has a restaurant, which is intended to become an open restaurant, thanks to its affordable prices, available not only to guests and travelers, but also to employees of local companies and local residents. The body of the hotel refers to simple forms from the 20s and 30s. It is ... only half of the building. In the next stage, the second wing will be created as a \"mirror image\".\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:3 nights in a standard room - unfortunately, we came across an alternative music festival or something like that and there were no better rooms. The hotel is supposed to be in the centre but in fact it is far away everywhere - unless to the Silesian museum - which I highly recommend because of both the collections and the fantastically adapted buildings of the former mine. They also have a bistro with good breakfasts : - ) As far as the hotel is concerned, the area is uncertain and in the evening it is better to return by car or taxi (prices are favourable). The classic rooms were probably recently painted because the traces of paint are on the furniture, the bed and everywhere else. The bathroom has been finished like this from 20 years ago, the shower is tiny. And everything could survive if it was clean, but unfortunately, for the first time in Novotel it was not so - obviously there is a problem with it. The lady for these 3 days did not replenish the bathroom wipes or cosmetics. Everywhere on the floors of both the room and the bathroom was full of hair. As a treat to greetings we received a plate of fruit which we did not eat all of us and so stood poor and mouldy throughout the stay and probably had to leave the room alone. . .

    "input": "Hotel Azzun is promoted as \"an intimate place with a unique design and atmosphere\". In my opinion, this is not true. First of all, the hotel is located at the BP gas station and nothing spoils the climate as much as the view of the gas station. . . Secondly, the hotel is located on the busy August\u00f3w - Olsztyn route. The hotel, although formally in the Masuria region, is far from the lakes. If you expect a quiet place among forests and lakes, you will be disappointed. The location fits more into a motorway motel for one night. The room - at the price of 250 PLN per one - is disappointing. From the window view of the roof covered with tar paper, small size. Unfriendly atmosphere . I resigned from my stay after the first 10 minutes, for this price you should expect something more. The decor of the hotel itself - which is supposed to resemble Roman thermal baths - is more overwhelming than relaxing. It's neither Roman nor Masurian thermae. This indecision as to the character of the place is its greatest disadvantage. The Roman thermae are best in Czeladz - and it's better to go there if you're a thermal fan. If you're looking for an intimate hotel in Masuria, choose agritourism. If you are looking for a place to have fun with a swimming pool - go to Mr\u0105gowo, e.g. Mrongovia Hotel (30 km away), where there is a sports pool, children's pool, slides, bowling etc.",

Everything used to be probably on a high level. Nowadays, a hotel needs a professional approach and money to raise it to these three stars. I do not recommend an autumn-winter stay. Heating problems (you can possibly count on a fella at the reception if there are not many people willing to stay). Hot water can be forgotten (barely lukewarm and after a long drain from the tap - pure waste! ) . The water in the pool of quite a suspicious quality ICE - even my husband couldn't immerse himself. The service is not very professional, probably students from a round-up, they have to keep a good face for a bad game. The plus is that they deserve spacious, ugly rooms and a kitchen.

After the exchange - heaven and earth. Surely our overall impression would be worse if we stayed in that room.

The plus is that the pool is open up to 24, of course nobody drips then but there is a drink bar, music playing, you can sit on the deck chairs by the pool. There is never a war for sun loungers because there is always a lot of free time. The hotel itself is a small 80 pairs of rooms, also the peace and quiet without animation.

In contrast, I will give you what the treatment of this problem looked like later in the clinic in Budapest - first consultations and pharmacological treatment (as it was said - essential in this case, because the disease can come back after the laser).

In February this year, on the last balance sheet, the family doctor felt a tumor on my neck. She got a referral for an ultrasound, which, as it turned out later, was misdescribed and had to do it again. The doctors told me that the tumor was already calcified and it was not cancer. After the biopsy, however, it turned out that I had suspected thyroid cancer. Dr. Gryglewski reacted immediately and the surgery had to be done about a week after receiving the results. My left thyroid lobe was removed. After two weeks, she got the result of the histopathological examination and found out that she had already been enrolled to the doctor. The result showed thyroid cancer. A few days later she had another operation and my right thyroid lobe and lymph nodes were removed from my neck. It was only when I received my second discharge from the hospital that I found out what she had actually experienced m . The card clearly stated \"malignant thyroid cancer\". After receiving the second histopathological examination, a stone fell from my heart. It turned out that there were no metastases. Now I have an endocrine consultation to find out if I have to have radiation therapy. The whole history of my disease went very quickly. The surgeries didn't turn out to be as terrible as it seems. All this time I was in good spirits. The first and second surgery was good for me. I'm a young person and she thought I wasn't affected by this kind of disease, and yet. I really encourage everyone to have regular check-ups and treatment myself.

We stayed for 4 days, accommodation and board as part of a group shopping voucher (plus a face massage for 2 people and a sauna session). In general we were very satisfied with our stay in the hotel as well as with the quality of services offered. We were positively surprised by the location of the hotel - practically in the middle of the Spa Park - as well as the appearance and spaciousness of the rooms, cleanliness and neatness of the room and bathroom. There were, however, quite ambiguous situations which left us with a disgust after our stay in the hotel. First of all, both the information available on the website and the information provided by the staff are not consistent with the actual state of affairs. When making a purchase I was very impressed by the information that there is a swimming pool in the hotel, which would result from the photos on the website and signed 'Villa Lessing' . After our arrival, however, it turned out that there is no swimming pool in the hotel and the photos were copied from the website of the Polanica Aquapark. The hotel staff also misled us by claiming that the hotel has a large parking lot and that we will certainly not have any problem with leaving the car. On the spot, however, it turned out that the parking spaces are only ok . 8 and we had to park 'in the wild' on the pavement. Another ' ambiguous ' situation took place when, after presenting the receptionist with a purchase coupon, she assumed in advance that only I want to take advantage of the purchased face massage. To arrange for your husband to have a massage they had to laugh, so they had to ask specifically. Perhaps the lady at the reception desk did not have bad intentions, but the impression remained that the hotel wants to save at the expense of its guests. We also very much missed any information about the menu and the form of dinner. We never knew what would be served on a given day. As a result, we started to eat out on our own. because we had no guarantee that we would like this proposal. In general, all these details made us feel confused at times and simply misinformed. If the staff had worked on some of the details of their offer, I think it would have a huge impact on the quality of service and the overall impression of guests. Pluses: - location - cleanliness in the rooms and bathrooms - courtesy of the staff - spacious rooms - neatness in the spa area - tasty breakfastsMinus: - wrong information on the website - few parking spaces - no coffee from the coffee machine during breakfast - quality of dinner (quality of food corresponding to the offer of the pottery, not the restaurant) - lack of information about the menu and the form of dinner - misleading (perhaps unintentional) the customer",

The hotel chain's hotels also have found the following unusual items: a winning EuroMillions lottery ticket, Bugatti keys, a classer with stamps worth 400 million USD and a Persian cat worth 962 USD, a scenario of a famous soap opera, an inlayed iPhone, a set of artificial teeth with diamonds, a Rolex watch worth 50,000 British pounds, a python brand snake and 76,500 hugs and mascots. As for 13 million people who stayed overnight in 2012 in 38 thousand rooms of Travelodge chain, this is quite a good result.

It's a pity that she didn't know about this fact before she chose it. The standard of rooms at a high level - in rooms with Jacuzzi or shower, minus a welcome package for one person in the form of one gel, shampoo and conditioner and no stationery. Rooms are cleaned but not washed floors throughout the stay - despite the fact that the floor was stained by previous guests. The air conditioning works perfectly - it is quiet. The service is very friendly and helpful. You can't complain here. The food is spiced and very good, not much, but every day something different and you can not accuse the monotony. However, I complain about the lack of regional dishes typically Greek, the kitchen is specially prepared for the taste buds of Europeans and especially Poles, including daily tomato soup. But the soups are great! No tea in the choice - only Lipton and nothing else. Shock ! Few sweets, few fruits. Service like cutlery and plates of very good quality . Waiter service at every meal . High percentage drinks only in the bar between meals . And for each meal on the premises of the restaurant to choose from - regular tea, water, coffee, beer, red or white wine. Tennis, volleyball, and a swing and one slide for children. The hotel had an indoor swimming pool but it was always closed. Spa area on request. The rivet is not sitting there. It is ordered at the reception. Very intimate hotel. Access to the beach by the chinch. Rocky beach, nothing happens there. Further to the right are the taverns and there is a possibility to rent a sunbed for two people and an umbrella for 7 euros per day but no interest at the turn of April/May. A very interesting beach Katelios for nudists is 40 minutes walk to the left, passing either through the rocks with beautiful views or through a mountain between sharp vegetation. The surroundings are beautiful and interesting. Mountainous and with wonderful views. And ONLY for those who seek peace and quiet. This is neither a hotel nor a region for party people. Nothing happens at the hotel, only there are taverns where you can eat regional dishes. Nearby is the Scale, about 7 km. It is a very interesting place and is worth a ride. The bus stop is about 350 m to the right, but during my stay no one has seen or heard it. If you are mobile with a rental car you will have no problem.

However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side.

After just 10 days of using this product, I noticed that the skin becomes more taut and firm. Although it didn't lift my bust clearly, I still think it is a good cosmetic. It is known that spectacular effects can only be achieved with plastic surgery. I have to point out that the firming and tightening effect is much stronger than in the case of top shelf creams, which I have used a lot. The product also has several disadvantages, namely the use of ampoules is very time consuming, the applicator often jams or breaks and you have to apply the liquid with your hand. I also think that for such a high price the effect should be more spectacular - but there are no miracles. I have not noticed any special skin hydration either.

There are constantly making some renovations (this is my next stay in this hotel and every time something is in the renovation). Spacious rooms, comfortable beds, but sleeping comfort is not best because of the noise. The room has no safe, no iron and no ironing board (no possibility of renting the room as well; you can pay for an ironing service or use a special room somewhere in the hotel).

It is a hotel in the very centre of Warsaw with a view of the Palace of Culture and business centre on one side, the National Stadium and the western part of Warsaw on the other.

The rooms are neat and clean. Minuses of the hotel: - very large number of guests, which makes it sometimes difficult to feel the atmosphere of rest there (it happened to me that a group of guests did not respect the night's silence and behaved loudly in the corridor). - parking lot outside the hotel (in the building next door) - which makes it necessary to carry luggage in an inconvenient way.

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:Unfortunately, I regret to say that I am dissatisfied with the visit to the doctor's. She signed up for a private visit, following her opinions after doing two pregnancy tests with results indicating pregnancy. I have never been pregnant before and she informed me about it. The doctor took an ultrasound of me and said that I couldn't see the pregnancy and couldn't tell her, after which she told me to come in two weeks. She informed me that I couldn't stand such a long time in ignorance and asked me if there were other ways to confirm it faster, and then she asked me: \"Why do you want to know that? Do you want to tell someone about it? \" I was surprised, because it is rather important information. She replied that I want to know if I have to take care of myself twice (it is probably obvious). The doctor said that the tests are often mistaken (she did two tests of different companies, so it is strange that both of them are mistaken). She got me a referral for a beta hcg blood test. The doctor informed me that if it is elevated it indicates a pregnancy, but that you should not yet be happy because it could be an ectopic pregnancy. You don't know where the pregnancy is and what it is. She was scared and shocked and came out of the office. The doctor stressed me very much and scared me. Worried about the ectopic pregnancy, she couldn't sleep at night, she cried. The next day she went to another doctor and only there she heard that she shouldn't worry because in such an early pregnancy (about 4 weeks), it is normal that you can't see anything on the ultrasound and that there is nothing that could indicate an ectopic pregnancy so early! and that there is no reason to think about it! I think that the doctor wrongly and unjustifiably scared me, instead of realizing in which week the pregnancy should already be visible and possibly if it wasn't visible you could mention the ectopic pregnancy at all. In addition, she didn't get any recommendations for nutrition, lifestyle or supplementation. No gynaecological examination during the visit, no question about the current cytology. The doctor seems to have probably stated that I am not pregnant, which did not work out. After the visit she felt terrible and felt much more insecure and afraid than before the visit .

The doctor definitely advised me against this procedure and calmed my fucked up nerves. I strongly recommend the doctor, she has a great approach, great knowledge and great modern equipment.

Later on it turns out that such a restaurant shines empty despite a large number of sleeping guests. Not to mention the people from outside. And in the best case it does not arouse as much interest as was forecasted in connection with the invested resources.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The hotel is not modern.

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:I strongly advise against visiting Dr. Mincewicz. The visit with a small child lasted about 15 minutes and at that time nurses with prescriptions for signature entered the office, which took about 5 minutes, so the whole visit lasted about 10 minutes. During this time the doctor diagnosed atopic dermatitis in the child. However, he did not give the reasons for this condition and did not indicate how to treat it, he only gave the phone number of his doctors friends to consult with them on the further course of treatment. After the visit, for which I paid 100 zloty, he expected something more and did not find out anything more than what he knew before entering the office . Your doctor's knowledge may be sufficient for adults, but he cannot deal with the problems of small children at all. Atopic dermatitis has outgrown the possibilities, experience and knowledge of the doctor - a provincial consultant in allergology and court expert in allergology and internal diseases. I strongly advise against visiting and consulting the doctor.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:We were on holiday in 4 adults. Flight from Warsaw without problems . Getting from the airport took about 1 hour, which with a little air-conditioned bus was a big relief. On the spot, we had to wait for a room because they are available only from about 14. 00 ( it depends on the speed of cleaning service ) . We had a room on the 4th floor. The view was very nice, a small terrace with plastics on the balcony allowed us to rest in the open air without leaving the room. The food was ok, with all of our 4th floor everyone found something for themselves. Additionally, it has been served for an hour. 12 . 00 - 24 . 00 pizza, hot drinks and fries and burgers in the poolside bar. Generally you can not be hungry. Alcohols served until 24h, generally as in Poland . All the service is generally very nice. The downside is certainly the fact that there are few umbrellas by the pool and people book chairs for sun loungers from about. 7 am . However, this is only about the place if someone wants to hide under the umbrella - if there is no problem with finding a place. Every evening there are animations in the hotel - performed by hotel animators and professionals. Every evening there is also a game of bingo. The head of the animators has mastered to perfection reciting the drawn number in several languages including Polish: ) From the hotel itself you go down the stairs to the beach and go for a swim. The downside is the fact that in days of high tide the water is terribly dirty and you can't rather use water baths - but if you don't mind, you won't have a problem with it. The town itself is only a few hotels, the center is located 5 minutes from the hotel - shops and bars, pharmacies, car rentals. When it comes to the assortment of souvenir shops it is terribly poor - apart from the local alcohol all souvenirs are a bit \"shit\". The hotel in general among our four got a very good reputation. You can surely \"hook up\" it's low light in the bathroom, uncomfortable enough bed, leaking air conditioning, but in connection with the fact that almost the whole day is spent in the pool or by the sea or sightseeing, you can not worry too much about it.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:It's hot on July 14th at 1 p.m. 00 the first guests crossed the threshold of the newly built Lamberton Hotel in Oltarzew near Warsaw (direction Poznan). We informed more about the construction of this hotel in the April issue of \"Hotels\". Nearly 100 people invited to the opening ceremony visited the hotel, got to know the staff, but most of all congratulated the building to the investor and had fun at the inaugural party. Hot and cold buffets were prepared by the hotel kitchen under the supervision of the Chef - Artur Raven. The afternoon and evening were enriched by vocal and instrumental performances of the opera duo, interspersed with dance music. Elegant in style and architecture, the Lamberton Hotel stands on a plot directly next to the A2 Warsaw - Poznan route.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in December. We were there with a trip abroad. In many rooms it was just cold, we had to ask for blankets or extra heaters. The rooms in the hotel were fine, although they were not crazy. Breakfast in total tasty, large, standard choice. The staff tried to do their best, although sometimes they were misleading (it was a form of payment for the stay) and had to repeat two or three times what it was about. The hotel has no parking and the bus had to stand very far away. The advantage is undoubtedly the location in the very centre. I do not know if it deserves 3 stars .\nAnswer:ambivalent",

Moreover, the employees did not even know for how long they arrived, in the system they had a one-day stay. They asked us to contact the manager, which was met with a categorical refusal of arrogant and insolent staff. They asked us for the official price list, but we were also sold. We were informed that the manager has the right to do whatever he wants because it's his hostel, he doesn't have to inform us about the price change, because it's our duty to call 2 days before arrival and ask if this reservation still exists at all. He added that the small print on their portal was given about the price change, however, when they asked us to show it, the employee said that he did not have access to it. When they told us that we were going to lodge a complaint with the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, an employee said that in that case he was going to ask us out of the hostel. Unfortunately, we were not the only ones affected, and we were accosted by many people with similar problems.

In which silver nanoparticles and microparticles were injected under rat skin. The microparticles did not enter the bloodstream, while the nanoparticles were transported to the kidneys, liver, spleen, lungs and brain.

She had her cuttings taken for histopathological examination. I am skipping the fact that the patients were treated in question and Mr. Mariak's comment: \"why anaesthesia, after all, curettage does not hurt\" . After 3 weeks she received my result and only because I have a medical education it seemed suspicious to me because it did not refer to the result of cytology with which I was referred to the hospital. Dr. Mariak treated me like an idiot and simply lied to my eyes. After a couple of days of my application, she got a completely new result, with a completely different (much more serious) diagnosis and the old one disappeared in strange circumstances. Of course, Dr. Mariak immediately suggested that he would sign me up for the procedure. As it turned out after some time, when she did a private re-examination of me, the result from the city hospital was false and any procedure was unnecessary. I am 24 years old and this whole story has cost me a lot of fear, nerves and almost health loss. It's all thanks to Dr. Mary, who I think is a liar and protects the asses of all those who might have been responsible for giving me the wrong result.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:She was looking for a dentist for fear that I would have root canal treatment (6 and 7 were very painful).

She woke up quite quickly and did not wait for breakfast (30 PLN). She gave me a grade of 4 - very good because she did not use the breakfast option, so it is difficult to give me the best note.

Despite the late hours of the bar party, the room was quiet and peaceful. Good free WiFi. The service, especially at the reception, was nice and helpful, although the waiting time for check-in is about an hour. 23 (half an hour with a sleeping child) was unacceptably long. The weaker side of the hotel was the food - breakfasts were different from hotels in the Mercure chain, especially abroad, and the food refill was also definitely not good. The hotel restaurant was not used by us. The offer of additional entertainment includes table tennis (but requires its own rackets), billiards, cymbage. However, the equipment is strongly tarnished (e.g. broken rackets left on the table tennis table did not encourage the use of fun). Outside the playground for children . The swimming pool is small, clean, although the walls would also be useful for renovation (flooding patches), rather to play than swim. A separate paddling pool for smaller children and a lot of water equipment is a good thing. No lifeguard in the pool. Water and air temperature OK; it is possible to go to the pool without going outside, which has advantages especially in winter; bath towels were reported to the room on request. In general, the hotel allows you to have a good weekend's rest, especially in the spacious room used by the ushers. However, the standard leaves to wish; especially at a price of over 500 PLN. ( weekend ) per day you can expect more. Generally the rating is between three and four \"stars\". The apartment was finally four, but only for a suite and above-standard helpful receptionist.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

He even said that \"please don't tell me anything, because you'll mess with my head\". The possibility of treatment was conditioned by the abundance of his wallet, repeating several times that \"he can do anything for me for 7 thousand. He said, \"You can do me a base for a thousand and a few studies for 1 thousand\" - without any elaboration or description. It did not guarantee cure, success, failure - it did not explain how these studies would help and look.

For the welcome we were supposed to receive a bottle of wine, which we received, but goodbye on the last day of our stay also after the intervention at the reception. Another matter is the use of the SPA, which we also had guaranteed in the package. Probably Mrs. Beata from the reception desk (black hair, stocky physique) tried to convince us that there are no vacancies for the Jacuzzi, which was a nonsense because the day before - in the evening another lady from the reception desk informed us that there are vacancies from 10 to 15. I would like to point out that there were only a few people in the resort so there was no possibility to fill all the places. Moreover, we were staying in the playroom next to the SPA from 10 o'clock. 15 and the lady told us that from 10 o'clock she had 2 sessions, but nothing like that happened because the jacuzzi was locked and there was nobody inside. When I asked why we could not take advantage of the offer from 10 .

Unfortunately the bathrooms. . . Tragedy! The hotel is definitely not opened last year. The bathrooms are 10 years old. They're not exactly cleaned either.

It seems to me that when I come privately to the doctor with the condition, then I guess I'm not the one who has to show understanding here. Especially since I'm shortly after a complicated operation, I was smashed with crutches on the tram all over town, and I had to come down and enter from the second floor and all this with a strong footache, but it's your doctor that doesn't care because he has a charmonogram which is sacred to him. There was still time, at least 5 minutes, during which he could take a look at this foot and give at least a prescription for a painkiller, but I have the impression that the doctor got scared of the patient in the orthosis after such a complicated injury, because as soon as he took a look at the discharge, he panicked at all and avoided talking about this leg and already the visit is over, he has no time. Finally, for the patient it is less important that he enters on time and more important that he is examined and listened to.

Modesty is not a sin (but I'm used to it because I went to an allergologist, who also liked to boast - quite rightly so - because she led me out of serious ailments). I don't know how it will be later and what effects the treatment will have. Anyway, he said: \"You are not worried, you will have a child, but you need to put your health in order\". He gave his mobile phone and said he was always on the phone and would answer questions if I didn't know something. The only thing that worried me was that he didn't put a card on me. He didn't write anything down etc. He looked only at my research (and there were a lot of it) and wrote me down what and how. However, he did not write anything down at home. The next visit he made was quite fast, again with an ultrasound, but in case of my ailment he would not see the results otherwise. So far, apart from the change of medication and the next visit he did not order me anything. He just announced what else awaits me. I'll see how it goes on and I'll say again, maybe even give a rating. P . S .

She heard a lot of good things from her friends before. When my daughter was born, in despair that she was so early that she was seriously ill that she could die - the light of hope shone - she goes to Opole, to Dr. Walas. And our first impressions were positive. Such a nice, committed doctor. Such a nice team. Then the first rasps appeared. And that's what my mother thought, that she leaned against the incubator. And that's what the nurse did to the parents. And this in an unpleasant way he \"interrogated\" on his morning visit a deadly tired doctor handing over the duty. We thought that eminent people sometimes have difficult characters. But then his nervous actions became dangerous for patients. I think it was just a tired day, but the doctor didn't record the problems reported by the nurses, he asked for the same thing several times. The next day after the operation on the chest, the little one had the painkillers stopped and the doctor leading the daughter explained that the accelerated heart rate is a symptom of anaemia and not pain, and the grimace on the face of the premature baby is not suffering, but stupidity.

This means higher return on investment, but also higher costs. If you consider advertising in search engines, metasearch platforms, remarketing, channel manager fees and similar expenses it is very easy to get lost and overpay.

So if the hotel pays an average commission of 22%, then 11% to download a direct reservation is a good CTA (cost per acquisition). What is your forecast for 2016?

After 2 months of her \" treatment \" When everything was supposed to be okay, she went to another doctor for a consultation where it turned out that the erosion was not cured at all. She lost a lot of money during these few months and the effect is that she returned to her initial state of health. I do not recommend it! Besides this minus is also the wholesale treatment of patients, strange comments and not very clear explanation of the causes of health and treatment.

He thoroughly and attentively interviewed Mom about her illness and the treatment she has received so far, he got acquainted with the results and presented his diagnosis and plan for further treatment. My Mom has been treated for many years for diabetes, the disease has intensified recently and it was necessary to turn on insulin. The doctor who has been treating Mom so far has not been able to convince her to insulin, which has had a very negative effect on her health, the sugars have gone crazy, and also sensory neuropathy has appeared, and consequently problems with the diabetic foot have started. As a result, Mom took very large amounts of medication and regularly had to go to the surgical clinic to change the dressing. The cost of treatment increased, the health condition deteriorated and the wound did not heal. . And when I was already broken down and lost hope, an acquaintance at the diabetes clinic recommended me to Dr. Ch\u0119ci\u0144ski. After the visit at your doctor's place, my mother convinced herself to insulin! After such a long time, after hundreds of conversations, no one was able to convince Mom to insulin, and one visit to doctor Ch\u00eaci\u00f1ski was enough.

In flats with carpet, significantly higher concentrations of allergens were found in dust deposited on the floor than in flats with smooth flooring. But at the same time, in flats without carpets, higher concentrations of allergens in children's cots were found; the exception was a dog allergen. \"So it turns out that this smooth floor will not always be a positive element in the home of an allergy sufferer,\" the expert said. It was interesting to note that the study showed that although in the case of apartments where there was a dog, or residents had frequent contact with it, there was a significantly higher concentration of its allergens, in the case of a cat such an obvious dependence was not present. \"In those flats where there was a cat, there was not always a higher concentration of cat allergen than in those where there was no cat,\" she noted.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:At first it seemed dangerous, the classes were conducted a little bit chaotic, but the colloquia was very simple.

A friend told us about the endoscopic surgeries in Poznan that after them you recover faster. The wife is a teacher and her one-year vacation was over. We went to Dr. Janicki. He confirmed the necessity of surgery and that such an operation can be performed endoscopically. They wanted us to get a fund because we do not earn so much. He said that all state hospitals have queues for many months and the only way to avoid them is to operate in a private hospital. My wife couldn't wait any longer and we decided to have surgery at Medpolonia hospital. The operation was still in the same week. Immediately after the operation the pain disappeared and the wife felt better. She could go home the next day, but she had to stay one day longer so that the physiotherapists could teach her spinal exercises. Eventually the surgery in a private hospital was not much more expensive than an earlier appointment in a state hospital. Not to mention the quality of service and comfort because we had a comparison with treatment in neurology.

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:Unfortunately, I cannot join in the flattering opinions. Your doctor's treatment in infants basically brings about a sewer injection. There was no interview, no research, no word about the treatment. After entering the office, I was given a card to sign the consent and the child was taken to the surgery, explaining that this is best for the child.  The baby was asleep, woke up on the table and was hungry and instead of eating this terrible procedure and still it was snoring for 7 days. Generally the baby experienced trauma (me too) afterwards it stopped eating and got very nervous and the consequences could be really serious. The procedure itself was done efficiently, but it didn't help because it wasn't there that was a problem that the doctor couldn't know about because there was no test.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:I do not agree with this opinion at all. . . . .I go to this doctor's clinic and he's very nice and nice.

However, in your statement you do not present any problems, symptoms that would not give you peace of mind, and which you pointed out to the doctor during the visit. Certainly, if you had reported any problems, I am convinced that you would not have been without the doctor's answer. In fact, it can be concluded that the pregnancy at the time of the visit was not objectionable to the doctor. The doctor has written down your vitamins in accordance with the course of your pregnancy and ordered a list of tests that you should do immediately and report back to the doctor. You don't write anything, after what time the tests were done, if everything was okay and when you came back to the doctor. You can only draw the conclusion that you have not been to see the doctor for at least 3-5 weeks. It should be remembered that the most important thing in the first weeks of pregnancy is to observe the development of the fetus, whether the fetus is developing in accordance with the adopted stages, and you should know about it yourself. Being in the 8th week of pregnancy, i.e. really in the 6th week after fertilization, such an early age of pregnancy is not always advanced enough to capture the heart rate of the embryo. At a later date, the nucleus of the heartbeat should be visible and it is possible to capture the heart rate on an ultrasound. You do not write anything that the doctor said while doing the ultrasound, if he had any doubts about the examination and correct development of the embryo. All this indicates that in your case it was still too early to determine the heartbeat, and the allegations you made are a little out of place and a lot out of place before making a diagnosis from the histopathological examination. However, there is no doubt that it is sad and unfortunately more and more common that the embryo stops developing at some point for various reasons, it can be caused by e.g. genetic defect or no hormonal demands etc. In such a situation you should experience any ailments such as fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, which you also do not mention anything about. It is known that the body treats a dead fetus like a foreign body and at least you should have a fever. There is no doubt that you should be vigilant during the first trimester of pregnancy and pay special attention to any changes in your body. After all, the doctor will not call you every day and find out if you have done tests and how you feel, much more interest in pregnancy should be on your side. Once again, I am very sympathetic to you and wish you good luck, as well as read the reading and proper preparation for your next pregnancy.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:I will give a neutral assessment, because the doctor has both advantages and disadvantages, more or less at a similar level. Maybe the doctor has medical knowledge and knows how to choose the right rehabilitation procedures, but on the other hand he has no approach to the patient. I was in his ward for rehabilitation (I was already after spinal surgery, but Dr. Lukaniec was not my attending physician). As a \"stranger\" I felt very bad, I simply cried out of nervousness after every round in the rehabilitation ward, and later on the rehabilitation exercises the women had to calm me down. He was making various attachments to me just because I wasn't his patient and he said that I shouldn't be in his rehabilitation ward, but I should go to Warsaw at the Medical Academy Clinic - the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Clinic on Lindley Street in Warsaw and let them rehabilitate me there, it didn't seem to be a good idea to explain that there is no rehabilitation ward and there are no rehabilitants in the clinic. Additionally, the doctor made jokes about the doctor who operated on me and as for me it is rude. In medicine it is not only medical knowledge that counts, but also the approach to the patient is important. And this doctor was only mean to me because she was treated by another orthopedist and it didn't matter that I was referred to the rehabilitation department by his colleague from the orthopedic department.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

She changed my doctor, she got my medication and I'm glad to start the 20th week. Everything's possible if the patient's well-being really counts. . . . . .even the smallest one. Also if you happen to hear a strange diagnosis I recommend to consult another gynaecologist.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:I highly recommend to the doctor. She can perfectly listen to the patient, who is in the first place for her. She is professional and at the same time warm, empathic and smiling. She explains in fact what the treatment will consist of, what drugs she will choose and how they will work, and at the same time she left the alternative in the form of psychotherapy to choose from. Discreet, gentle, wonderful person who thoroughly learns the situation of the patient to diagnose him. After the visit she felt the flow of positive thinking. I have light depressive symptoms associated with work and long wondered whether to go for a visit or act alone. I recommend to all hesitant people. Just to get diagnosed and to talk.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:I see a lot of positive opinions about the Doctor here. I happen to need a consultation with a dermatologist.

Fortunately, the walls are reinforced enough that the laptop did not suffer. It is worth noting, however, that my laptop is quite heavy, so in case of a smaller version this problem may not be as significant. I don't know how much the company has saved on the use of plastic mountings instead of metal, but they would do better to increase the price by a few zlotys so that in return you don't have to worry about whether the mount will last. It also lacks a more sensible front pocket to fit the power supply and mouse. Yes, you can squeeze it in there, but then the pocket is unnaturally stuffed and theoretically this could lead to a dent in the laptop lid.

At the swimming pool vending machines: cola and such drinks, milk shake, ice cream machine (mmm), machine with iced drinks, coffee, tea, juices, freezer with 6 flavors of ice cream. Friendly service, helpful in every case and at any time. The views of the earth, the hot sea, the beach is actually only friendly, a short walk along the promenade. Music by the pool from 10 : 30 - 24 : 00 . The animations were pretty successful - no constant persuasion and everyone was having fun anyway. The hotel has a predominance of groups from Poland, Germany and England. The pool is shallow and the water is cruelly cold, but it was a good cooling down. Weather in September - great. 30 degrees every day, and the strong winds made you not feel it. A big, spacious room, all right. We were with friends and we are delighted with everything that was waiting for us on the spot, and being in Poland we miss the delicious food and desserts. In our opinion the hotel deserves more than 3 *, I guess I guess they are not there because of: - No facilities for the disabled, - No elevator, - No possibility of going anywhere without walking on the stairs. To the pool stairs, to the room stairs, to the restaurant, to the beach - stairs (but that's good, maybe that's why I didn't gain any more weight :) ) - to the city / restaurants, clubs (there are 3 larger ones) super close, but access to other places despite the buses can sometimes be difficult. The palm tree can be reached by one bus starting from a bus stop near the hotel only 2 times a day, and goes for 2 hours, the cost of such an expedition is 18, 10 E. Buses to closer places are much more frequent, but they take many people so even 10 km can take 40 minutes. It is good that they are air-conditioned and in looser hours you can sit down: ) If someone is interested in renting a car then it does not look so bad although it is worth looking carefully at the contracts (they say that there is no deposit and then it is added after 20 E for delay or some other things) . We thought about the scooter, but even for it there was a 200 E deposit and 30 E for renting. We did without it because we were all set to relax so the bus trip was also a sightseeing tour of the area and the views, and in the bars nobody regrets alcohol so it would be hard to get up in the morning at the wheel.

The number of sun loungers available by the hotel pools was sufficient, but they were in two variants and not all of them were desirable. The sun loungers were dirty, damaged, all in oils, sweat and various drinks. The hotel was mainly occupied by the British, probably from the lower social class - loud and rude.

So what are the good things about the hotel; it is certainly a big (for Albania's standard) swimming pool, where we had a lot of fun. Basically, after crossing the promenade that bordered the hotel was the beach, so you can move freely from the pool to the beach and vice versa. The beach service is free of charge and the staff make sure that everyone finds a place for themselves. We also enjoyed the food. It is not as lavish as it is in other countries, but it is enough not to feel hungry. Lunches and dinners were getting better and better every day and there was never any shortage for anyone. If someone likes sweets very much, then unfortunately, the dessert hotel was dominated by fruit, head watermelons and melons - delicious, sweet and certainly better than a cake with cream. The extremely nice and helpful staff also took care of the comfort of our stay. The hotel room, which is the most important for us, was clean, cleaned daily. It was visible that it was still in the so-called \"finishing\" phase. But it didn't bother us at all, because we spent little time in it and it didn't affect the use of it at all, because all the necessary aspects (bathroom, air-conditioning, comfortable beds) were flawless. At this stage it is a hotel for people who do not mind the lack of lighting on the balcony or the choice of \"only\" two kinds of meat during meals.

I got to him after I couldn't get pregnant for six months. He did not order any hormone tests; without tests he ordered me to take Duphaston first, then Clostilbegyt in a horse dose (2 tablets a day at 50 kg). Not once did I have an ultrasound, so it is not known if there was any effect of administering Clo. The doctor first stated that I have no ovulation cycles (which later turned out not to be true), then that I probably suffer from PCO but laparoscopy and ultrasound ruled it out. After the laparoscopy she heard that I would be pregnant for six months (5 months have passed and I am not) even though she knew that the problem with us is largely male. He never proposed monitoring the cycle. Now that we've finally changed doctor and I've done all the necessary tests I know that everything is rather OK with me - it's just a pity that only the next doctor has ordered me to do these tests because maybe we could do without laparoscopy and we would approach the insemination right away. . . : (\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Focusing on the patient's ailments, assessing the degree of \"wear and tear\" of the spine and making an appropriate diagnosis. Opponent of unnecessary talk about everything and nothing from the patient. For the Doctor, what matters is only concrete . This is how Dr. Kwiek briefly described me during my first visit to Miko\u0142\u00f3w (she was my companion) and my daddy described the patient. In front of him there was a diagnostic blockade in the hospital in Mo\u015bcickiego Street in Chorz\u00f3w.

Other doctors (an otopaedist, neurologist, urologist) have been prescribing further pills, which in fact did not help much. We hope that this blockade will quickly detect the place of pressure. Then the surgery will restore the father's former physical condition. I'd like to add that without an MRI scan of the spine there is no point in making an appointment. This is the most important thing to have with you! I am allergic to this aspect, because the doctor will not do anything without it.

Chris Seal from the University of Newcastle explained: \"Increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with the reduction of cardiovascular disease, improved development and functioning of the nervous system, and better immune system. As he comments, the Western European diet is considered to be too poor in these fatty acids - European Food Safety Authority. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends doubling their consumption. \"However, it is difficult to get enough of them from our diet. Our research suggests that the switch to organic products may have some impact on increasing the intake of these important nutrients\", points out Prof . Seal . A systematic review of the scientific literature from around the world has shown that organic milk and meat have a more desirable fatty acid profile than conventionally produced milk and meat. Most importantly, a shift from conventional to organic products would increase the intake of omega-3 fatty acids without simultaneously increasing the amount of calories supplied and undesirable saturated fats.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:I share Dr. Agrawal's opinion that poor nutrition and stress are the greatest dangers to the body's organism, as I have found out by going on a proper diet and I can see that there are few doctors who holistically look at humans. Dr. Agrawal made a very good impression on me at the beginning because of her positive energy and peace of mind, and she was enthusiastic about her recommendations, she took care of my health because her diagnosis was very convincing. However, she convinced me once again to be sensible to treat such methods as well. Unfortunately, the doctor made a wrong diagnosis - excess estrogen, which she decided to confirm with blood tests. It turned out that my hormones are normal. If I hadn't checked it, today I would have been lubricated with ointment with progesterone written down by the Doctor, but why? I am also not convinced to recommend the so-called 'em - these are beneficial bacteria (with a mixture of herbs), and as you know, such bacteria are needed in the intestines, so they must first pass through the stomach. Drinking such a liquid with bacteria, whether they are able to survive in the stomach - rather poor chances so I prefer to take the current market symbiotics in special capsules. However, I can see very good effects after the Sunny concoction (olive oil, alocite, lemon) prescribed by the doctor. Natural methods of treatment are great - but girls, be careful, complement this knowledge with simple research and your own intuition. I guess she would be afraid to entrust me with leading the pregnancy with the Doctor, unless I have another doctor at the same time. Although I agree with many things, I think it's all too much responsibility, and most of all, the doctor, who calls himself holistic, doesn't pay enough attention to one thing. It's all too chaotic, although a noble goal.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

At the end he presented me with situations as if the child must be sick for sure. He did not give me any hope that maybe it will be good that there are chances that the child will be born healthy and yet she heard that \"how can I remove something up to 20 weeks\" - a poor consolation for a 30 year old woman who has just collapsed the whole world.

What do you offer different? We try to be different than everyone else. Our resort is founded on a SPA plus hotel. As a rule, the SPA is an addition to the hotel, with us it is the opposite. SPA is the basis of a wide range of wellness, massages, oriental rituals and a set of specialized, high quality cosmetic services. And what fits under the term wellness we also have, of course, that is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, saunas, baths, salt cave. Do you know a facility in the Podkarpacie region, which offers a similar range of services? There is no such .

No one helped with the luggage after driving up to the hotel, but then there was a proposal to take it to the room. Just check in without waiting, efficiently and quickly. But the restaurant is a different world. The day we arrived, we were not allowed in the restaurant because the party was closed. We were suggested to use other nearby restaurants. It seems to me that it was both a big negligence on the part of the hotel to bring about such a situation. If the restaurant is too small, you shouldn't have a closed party - after all, it's not a failure. The next day we tried to take advantage of it, but also after we had read the menu, we resigned. Very small choice and decidedly exaggerated prices, especially for what it offers. To sum up: a nice place in the very centre of the old town, but you should eat after the hotel.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

The set of genes of our small tenants (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses or parasites) are microbial. It is easy enough for a microbiome to be examined by analyzing a faecal sample and sequencing the genes contained therein.

There's a reason it's called Green, a lot of greenery there and a specific, slightly outdated, albeit interesting decoration, seeing that someone has arranged it according to their own vision. I liked it. From what I saw, only two ladies work there. Attention, there's a dog that at first is threatening to bark and run up. It's only a pretence, because he's getting scared of dogs later, but someone who's afraid of dogs can be pretty scared. LocationA good starting point for the surrounding castles. Besides, it's an uninteresting neighborhood, on a very busy street (although you don't feel it in the back garden, you couldn't hear in your room either). Very nice, both ladies, there was no problem with an earlier check-in. I would have given a good grade, but there was one big disadvantage: If it comes to food, the ladies tried very hard, especially in the case of dinner, but unfortunately, there was a big one. I got sour milk for breakfast on the first day. Okay, one such accident can happen, I just noticed myself when I put it in the coffee. But besides, we got two (!) months' overdue butter and this shouldn't have happened. There comes out a certain carelessness about the freshness of the products. Dinners were even tasty and nicely served, but that I couldn't be sure about the freshness wasn't very much to enjoy. A very cool Spa, a revelation for me. Some may say it's rubbish because it doesn't look like most hotels, but according to the fact that it's not a plus, there's a real relaxing atmosphere. In most hotels it's more like a floating man feels. And you can also order yourself a beer or a drink at the Spa, I've never seen it before. The pool is even deep, which also rarely happens and not as small as it seems in the pictures. The room was ok, except for the dryer was all you need, even the bathrobes at the Spa get included. The furniture wasn't the first freshness so the room doesn't make you feel like it's going to be perfectly clean but for me it's not a problem, I don't walk on an executioner with a white glove.

And in winter and spring the hotel is a great place for a family stay. We have comfortably accommodated ourselves in a room with an extra bed and a cot for a baby. Meals are mostly standard but extended with meals typical for kids (e.g. nougets and fries, pancakes etc). In April, with a lower occupancy, instead of a buffet, we chose meals from the cut-off card in the restaurant, everything was beautifully served and delicious. The hotel itself is beautifully situated, with a large playground, there is also a bicycle or sledge rental in winter, so there is something to do. A great thing is also a children's playroom, with lots of different toys, board games and computer games rental, and organized attractions for children (workshops or cinema on the big screen). In the spa part of the pool and paddling pool with a slide, jacuzzi, saunas, the treatments were not used by us. I don't know if we would rest in the strict season when the hotel has full occupancy. If you are planning to buy a package through the Travelist portal, I advise you to read what is included in the price and whether you will not need to pay extra, for example, for participation in workshops for children or a cot for a baby.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:\"The optimal temperature for our body is 20-24 degrees Celsius\" - Andrzej K\u0119dziorski, PhD from the Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection of the University of Silesia, told PAP. How does the body cope with getting rid of excessive heat? \"Our body has no other possibilities to give away heat than through evaporation. That is why you have to drink a lot of fluids\" - said the scientist. In his opinion mineral water is the best; it can be slightly salted. On the other hand, the food should be easily digestible. It is best if there are a lot of vegetables and fruits on the menu. On hot days you should avoid alcohol. \"Drinking alcohol during hot weather is very dangerous and can lead to serious health consequences, and even death\" - specialists from the Regional Rescue Station in Warsaw warn. That is why beer consumption - often advertised as a refreshing drink - is not a good idea during hot days.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Overall, the cot looks nice. The look and design are undoubtedly advantages. Unfortunately, the quality of materials leaves much to be desired: - railings made of plywood, which breaks when screwing on the side rails, - easy removal of 2 side rungs, which is convenient for parents, but can be dangerous for the child, - mattress rungs made of plywood, which under the influence of moisture softens and bends The only truly wooden elements are the rungs of side rails. The cot will not work at all if someone is planning it for more than one child. After disassembling when trying to twist the product the elements are unfortunately very loose and the cot is completely unstable. In my opinion it is better to pay a little more for a better quality product.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

From the very beginning it was very difficult to set it to fall evenly in line with the edge of the toilet bowl. Conclusions: for such a heavy flap there should be a system of slow descent on both sides of the flap's mounting; the upper part should be lighter and not necessarily made of duroplastic but of a more flexible material; the designers did not think about the small convenience of a profiled small wrist recess to lift the flap.

In an adult, more cannabinoids will force one group of cells to work more intensively, but at the same time will weaken the effectiveness of the other and blood glucose levels will not change or may even increase significantly. The discovery of the role of cannabinoids in communication between alpha and beta cells brings hope for more effective treatment of diabetes with pancreatic island transplants. Transplantations of this type can still be performed today. For this purpose, a piece of suitable tissue is taken from a dead donor and placed under the gastric mucosa. \"The effects, however, are temporary because the beta cells often lose their identity: they are still alive, but they stop producing insulin.

However, I have some reservations about the offices in Sanivitas: there is no screen or even a curtain that the patient could take off her clothes for examination or treatment. You simply take off your clothes in front of the desk, behind which the doctor sits, or by the chair at the door.

We live in a two-storey house in the countryside and we are struggling with this problem, so I can imagine what it must look like in the block.

Sometimes the receiver is standing in front of my eyes so I can see what is going on, for example thanks to the red alarm screen, and this sound would wake up the deceased. It happened to me that after huffing the baby, I would set up the camera and turn on the receiver to check if everything was visible, and here the receiver did not find the signal and screamed.

I am sick with a severe form of haemophilia A . It is a disease characterized by hemorrhages to the joints after the slightest injury or even spontaneous in the severe form of haemophilia as it was in me . Hundreds of hemorrhages have completely destroyed my knee joint, leading to a very saggy leg. An additional difficulty and obstacle in performing the operation were shin ulcers - occurring in haemophilia as a side effect of bad blood circulation in legs. Only Dr. Piotr \u017bbikowski undertook to insert my endoprosthesis with a bone graft - in my case it was necessary due to the total destruction of the joint. As you can see, a complete ride on a gang without a handhold! ! ! For me, Dr. Piotr \u017bbikowski is an ABSOLUTNESS UNIQUE, both as a man and as a doctor - the first of the class among the doctors I have met, and having been treated for several dozen years, I have met many of them. High culture, commitment, knowledge, professionalism, precision in operating on the operating table. And all this combined with great cordiality, an ordinary human approach to the patient, care for him before and after the operation, which gives a great sense of security. Dr Piotr \u017bbikowski always has time for the patient, he doesn't know the word no, I can't, I can't, I can't, I don't have time, I can't help it - he's just a true passionate, full of professionalism and human empathy - and so a true medical calling.

In an e-mail contact the doctor did not answer precisely the questions I asked and quite generally he said that the nature of the ailment is transient and everything can be done with the shoulder, but I do not know if all these are everyday activities or more advanced, such as exercises with the burden on the body. It is time that will show the thought . For now, a neutral commentary .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Mr. Peter came to 'em with a pain in the wrists interfering with the training. I had the impression that the diagnosis was already made after he told em that I was training CrossFit. Mr. Peter did a number of other activities such as bending wrists, movements in all planes etc. Even though in some cases the pain was felt, he got 'em informed that all by excessive physical effort which should be limited and focus on the other muscle parts. Please don't misunderstand me - I don't want to question either the compliment or the diagnosis itself that everything is ok - I'm glad I have no major problems. However, I'm not satisfied with the situation itself where nothing has really changed after the consultation, the pain as it is and I didn't get any indication of what to do with it except to actually completely give up training for 2 weeks. For the price of such a visit to Enel - Med ( 175 PLN ) this is really not enough for me. Especially that the marketing of the Medical Center itself invites you to a consultation under the slogan \"Injury? With us you will certainly quickly regain your fitness\" . Also, I strongly advise against people practicing sports, it is not worth paying for 10 minutes and the information that the most frequent patients with such a problem are those who practice yoga and crossfit. Prewarning the question, that since it actually turned out that nothing else ails me, what else did you expect em to do? Well, he expected me to have specific information about what is the cause of the pain. Now all I know is that it probably happened by doing too much exercise and the result is pain. Still, however, I have no idea \"what\" really happened and how I can avoid it in the future. I have had similar problems in the past and now I have returned to training with great caution, paying attention to the correct technique and trying to increase weights slowly enough.

Instead of getting reliable help they were given the possibility of long monologues and not getting help as they try to deal with their fears. Now, after consultation with therapists who are conducting therapy in the behavioural cognitive, humanistic or integrative stream, I know that this stream was completely misguided. In addition, psychotherapists were shaking their heads when they found out that with my anxiety disorders the current was chosen.

Even before the visit, it was easy to notice not only the high personal culture of the doctor, but also his serene disposition. During the visit he listens tactfully, selects words skilfully and is ready to give comprehensive answers. In the meantime, he takes precise notes. He draws conclusions aloud to confront them with the patient's feelings and confirm them. Once the diagnosis has been established, he clearly describes the medicine he has chosen, its effects and warns of possible side effects. In my case, an additional fast-acting drug was needed.

He admits that it is difficult to find a common language in this. \"For example, the doctor tells us that in the acoustic signal from the stethoscope it is important whether he he hears any whistling. But we have to find out what kind of whistles he is talking about and examine what characterizes these sounds\", says Dr. Nowak. Dr. Nowak reminds us that today, with the help of a stethoscope examination, doctors initially detect e.g. heart murmurs of newborns. Only 40 percent of children who were referred for further examination are confirmed to have significant disorders. \"I know what parents experience when they wait with their child for a cardiologist's examination. My daughter was also wrongly suspected of having a heart defect on the basis of a stethoscope,\" admits the acoustician. She adds that due to the imperfections of the device, the opposite situation can also happen: there are no defects in children, who should be treated further. According to Dr . Nowak's opinion is that the effectiveness of these preliminary tests could be improved by modern devices which he is developing.",

As far as the visit itself is concerned - nice - in fact, and despite the fact that the doctor is supposedly 15 minutes per patient, he examines until he achieves the expected effect of this examination and in my opinion we should be happy with such young and well-educated doctors because they leave abroad so quickly.

A large aquapark, a large hotel so it was easy to have peace, quiet and relaxation. . . A year ago the buffets passed by themselves, scallops, snails, venison, kangaroo cutlet, excellent for several years strogon boeuf, large selection of fish, both hot and cold. These flavors remembered 'em. After all, you could relax in the lobby bar with a bottle of beer \"fresh\" or a glass of wine. And for that I will repeat the peace again. . . Encouraged by a four-fold fantastic vacation, completed with all-day relaxation in the saunas, salt cave and aquapark pools, I went to Pigeon for another. The year 2017 holiday time to start . The first impression was made by the reception, this year a nice surprise, because we came to the hotel thickly before the time, but we were offered a room at once without having to wait for a fixed hour check in. We even offered us a room with no problem at all and we would be happy to go for a walk in Santa Claus. . . . .plus for hotel staff . I felt fair as a guest you are waiting for. Two hot spots in the room, half an hour of spinning at the panel and the temperature of 28 degrees, ok contact the reception - as an explanation the lady at the reception desk corrected that there is no air conditioning in the rooms and the \"cooling system\" so it will certainly not be as cool as with a classic air conditioner. Okay, but if I report it, I'll send the conservator. Here's another plus, because the restorer was already after 5 minutes, a quick check-up and bingo - the aerated system - after five minutes was after the problem, cool, nice, pleasant. Congratulations to such an employee - I think so far ok. From this place a heartfelt applause for the maids - quick cleaning, towels changed every day, the room perfectly vacuumed, all in all the plus.

The second point of alcohol - the size of the drinks served does not satisfy even the dwarf - long island in this size is a mockery and the price of 50zl is a bad joke. Beer 12 zloty - okay, but the wine weathered and warm is a big fusion. The late coffee served again in a glass for about 200ml is another minus. Quite a long wait for the realization of the order - with an occupancy rate of about 30% in the lobby bar - you have to wait over 30 minutes for a glass of wine.

In fact, they are not surprised because I would run myself if my parents would party in my room. It's just a wonder if there are no suitable places in the hotel?

After a week at the follow-up visit, she decided to take a smear. It turned out that the bacterium was resistant to oral antibiotic and there was no point in giving it. The wife was breastfeeding during this time and the baby was unnecessarily exposed to the antibiotic. Two consecutive visits consisted of changing a drop to another with antibiotics. Unfortunately, after over 3 weeks of treatment there was no significant improvement . The change of doctor and the use of prescription and antibiotic-free drops made the problem disappear after less than 2 weeks of treatment. We do not recommend.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:The product is of excellent quality and is intended mainly for people with gum problems. Thanks to the thickened formula, a small amount (even half a cm) of paste is enough to apply to the brush and after a while, a rich foam forms in the mouth. The paste has a strong mint taste, smells good, and its salutary effect on gums can be seen after just a few days of use. The product, due to its small size, is worth buying if, for example, we go on a business trip for a few days (we can easily fit the tube into a beautician). However, it is not worth buying this product when we intend to use it at home. It is definitely more profitable to buy a larger package.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:\"The device will resemble a classic breathalyzer.

The air exhaled by man contains about 500 different compounds, but scientists want to check four of them . The most important will be acetone, because its increased level may indicate diabetes mellitus. \"When we know how much alcohol there is in the exhaled air, we also know how much it is in the blood.

I've been treating with P . doctor for a few months. I have a problem with oily skin, sensitive, atopic and acneous skin (I am 37 years old). I started the treatment with a series of acids - they helped a little but for a short time. then the treatment was changed to other, more pharmacological. At the moment, once a month I undergo the \"regeneration\" treatment. my skin has changed radically to better. I think that the medical and dermatological help I received from your doctor was and is adapted to every stage of the treatment and only such accurate, quick and precise help is successful.

I don't know this doctor so I'll speak up after the visit. But I have a request, has someone already done a similar examination with him? She would like to know if I know this doctor? Can someone tell me something about him? There are a lot of opinions here, but most of them are about the pregnancy and they are very extreme so I can't make up my mind and I am confused.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Well, at Mr. Sankowski's, I was at the ORTHOS clinic, despite my limited right hand mobility associated with the pain, I found out nothing. The visit lasted less than 10 minutes. Something like \"pay and fall\". No information about my condition, only after I pressed and pulled out the information, she obtained my residual information in the style, \"maybe, I think, probably. . . . . .etc. \" none of the basic examinations (ultrasound, X-ray) were done only on the basis of external examination. The only thing she got is an MRI recommendation. So far, I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't want to make a bad judgment because you are very nice and kind, but in my opinion, not very factual, maybe she got m on one of the bad doctor's days? I will try again when I do an MRI and then I will verify my grade.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

When she refused this form of treatment, the doctor wrote down an antibiotic (also very common), which told me that she used to use m once, but after finishing the treatment everything came back. The doctor's answer is \"at some point it must finally help\". So the doctor's approach is after the corpse, after all, this chemistry must help. The liver will sit down at the most. Doctor, not very talkative, dry, probably she spent too much time in this office (almost 20 minutes!), because other patients were already killing each other. No opening to other forms of treatment, smells of signed agreements with pharmaceutical companies. I do not recommend .

Unfortunately, it seems that it is not always worth following the opinions of other people. Maybe she was an exception, but here's how my visit went: in the clinic spent about 3 hours, but on the conversation with Dr. Zwinczewska spent maybe 5 minutes. Please do not be guided by the hours set on the portal, because you still have to wait an hour for the visit to start. The system looks like it takes a few people at a time, it has the receptionists do the tests and the whole visit takes place in several parts. Taking care of so many people at the same time, nobody is able to take good care of all the patients and so it happened in my case. So what if she is nice and smiling at the same time, if there were a few unpleasant situations along the way, one examination was done three times, the doctor herself was distracted, she told me something that did not happen, she kept entering and leaving the office. She gave a piece of paper with the names of the drops and recommended tests to the receptionist who could not explain to me why I should take these drops and what these tests are for. . . I also had to ask the optician for a certificate of the degree of my vision impairment, because I wanted to press my expensive glasses on the spot.

Only the cleanliness of the carpets still needs to be improved, because sleeping in the room after a dog or cat is not the most pleasant.

As a member of the LCAH, he received an upgrade of the rooms that he booked 'em in, a gift was waiting in the room with a handwritten welcome letter from the hotel's director. As part of the welcome drink - a wide range of offers. As part of the \"Time for Sightseeing\" offer, we received free vouchers from the hotel to be used in the Gdynia Film Centre, which is located next to the hotel. Free non-alcoholic beverages in the Privilege room - a great solution, although we used them in moderation: ) . I recommend the hotel restaurant - especially fish soup we liked. And Mr. Luke - a waiter, who . . . sweeps - an amazing personality - the right person in the right place. The hotel's swimming pool is the weakest point of the facility - it is probably currently in the swimming school franchise, but this does not bother the hotel guests - a little bit intimate, but the advantage is the full size and sauna. The location of the hotel is excellent - it is close to the harbour and there are many cool bars and pubs nearby. The surroundings of Gdynia Film Centre and Music Theatre adds to the reputation of the place. Generally speaking, my opinion of the hotel is actually the highest possible. The hotel has restored my faith in the LCAH Program, which after previous experience did not have too high \"flights\" with me.

Thirdly, she got a prescription for a vaginal medicine to which she was apparently allergic and for 5 days she suffered from a doubling of the disease (terrible itching) - I do not blame the Doctor for the allergy, but I think she should recommend me to check if I do not have an allergy, because it was a medicine that maintained its effects for 5 days after one application, so she had no possibility to stop taking it (I will add that it was quite an expensive medicine, about 40 z\u0142).

My visit cost about 300 PLN because apart from the consultation with Dr. Bartnik, I was given a basic audiogram of my hearing, the same as in any other clinic (e.g. in OTO MEDIC in Cracow, the cost of such an examination is 50 PLN). So if somebody hopes that in the mentioned Medincus centre they will do some specialist tests for you, it is better not to waste time and money because the same tests can be done in every bigger city and it is much cheaper. As for the consultation with Mrs. Dr. Bartnik it was one big tragedy, for my question how to treat noises got 'em the answer that noises can basically not be cured and you have to learn to live with them when I started pushing to learn more about noises, Mrs. Bartnik told me the basic slogans about the treatment of noises (laser therapy, oxygen therapy, habituation method etc.). ) which anyone can find on the internet in 5 minutes and that's where my treatment with Mrs. Grazyna Bartnik ended. So if you are hoping to get help with tinnitus, I advise you to look somewhere else because this whole centre \"Medincus\" apart from a nice name has nothing new to offer, it will only take a few hundred zloty from you for the information you can get on the internet in 5 minutes.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Dr. Pawel Nachulewicz is a rare doctor who performs his mission with mission and dedication. In CM Sanitas in Lublin at the beginning of April he had cryptorchidopexy surgery on my son. I won't say, we were afraid of the operation, we didn't know how the anesthesia would pass, what will be the ailments after the operation. The tandem of doctors Dr. Krys and Dr. Nachulewicz turned out to be a very good team. They approached the small patients with great culture, tact, feeling and calm. The procedure went smoothly. Dr. Nachulewicz discussed the course of the surgery very culturally and calmly, Dr. Krysa perfectly informed about the anesthesia and possible consequences. Then everything went great. You can have 100% confidence in both men. They are real professionals, but most of all they feel the fears and anxieties of their parents. It's a shame that there are less and less doctors like that, but you have to be happy that you still are. After the procedure, both doctors were interested in patients, they came, looked after, really great respect for the approach to patients and their families. I recommend Dr. Pawel Nachulewicz with absolute certainty that he is the best pediatric surgeon you can come across. Oh, my God.

She is interested in the patient's lifestyle (e.g. how she eats, smokes, etc.) and this is good because many gynaecological diseases are caused by the poor condition of the whole body. Her methods of treatment are long-term, she does not write down \"aggressive\" drugs. I have vaginal inflammation which I have been treating with Mrs. Agrawal for quite a long time and decided to finally go to another gynaecologist. It is possible that I am not consistent enough in Mrs. Agrawal's natural methods and I cannot fully cure myself. It is like with other diseases, you can fight them by increasing the immunity of the whole body but sometimes the disease is so strong that there is no other method of treatment except \"aggressive\" therapy (e.g. antibiotics). I recommend Mrs. Agrawal to all women who want to be more aware of their body, but at the same time it is worthwhile to use the help of a more \"traditional\" gynaecologist (I do so).\nAnswer:ambivalent",

If the only effective solution is cryosurgery you have to say why, but also take an interest in whether the patient can afford it for sure.

They pushed it away from us. After entering the hotel lobby we were pushed away by an uninteresting smell, difficult to define, as if it was a room of old dust with something undefined.

Slightly older children, who are probably already walking, can easily cope with these safety devices. From the moment of installation, the glue will usually weaken a little and then all it takes is one jerk and the drawer stands open. You can use these protections but you should not absolutely trust them. If you have a child, you should simply put the child's dangerous items into inaccessible drawers or on higher shelves.

The drugs she attributed unfortunately did not help to get rid of the feeling of a blocked nose. Unfortunately, the doctor could not help me fully. I was with her 4 times with a recurring change in her hand, which each time she treated with the same medicine of different name or antibiotic. With each visit, even a control visit she paid me full rate and after spending 500 PLN or more I have no improvement.

Mrs. Iwona answered our questions with stoic calmness, she dispelled our doubts, she took the medicines perfectly at once, the side effects of their intake almost did not occur thanks to appropriate doses, and most importantly, the improvement of the skin in the son was already visible after a month and then it was only better. The treatment lasted almost a year, and the son was under constant laboratory control, which proves the great responsibility of the doctor for the patient.

It is time that will show the thought . For now, a neutral commentary .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The visit was quick, the doctor was a bit annoyed by my long trouser that bothered her here and there, and you could look at it with humour.

    "instruction": "You are a sentiment classification model. Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:I have to divide my assessment of the treatment of Mr. Arkadiusz's crooked nasal septum into two categories. The effectiveness of the treatment is assessed as 5 / 5, here I can not have any objections. However, the comfort of the treatment itself is an exclamation point. The operation took place in C . M . Sanitas in Lublin . I have to admit that lying down on the operating table on my own, without any sedatives, is not a pleasant experience, and even more so a recurring consciousness during the operation, at the end of which I felt clear pain. I had no idea at the time that I was being operated on, and the voices I heard were the conversations of the operating team. The very fact that I was leaving the anaesthesia was also very unpleasant, and I tried to wake up by very bluntly speaking commands to which I was not able to react. It was a very unpleasant feeling, I had no idea what was happening to me and why someone was putting pressure on me to finally wake up when I couldn't even nod, say a word or make contact in any other way. The pain after waking up was very clear, when it started to get worse after the second ketone drip, I didn't get any more painkillers even though I was being asked for them. The \"how it hurts, i.e. that he is alive\" was said with a smile on the nurse's lips, who later also exerted pressure to leave the bed more quickly at the end of his stay, even though he didn't feel like he was still able to get home a few hours after surgery. When I was finally expelled, the pain intensified to such an extent that all night long I walked around the house and groaned 'em, which probably made me vomit for a while. For 2 weeks I felt terrible, I had no strength for anything, most of the time lying in bed with a high temperature. After the surgery I was still at Mr. Arkady's, several times, on pulling out the setons, 2x on removing stitches and pulling out the \"plates\" which hurt as if someone tried to pull out the ones at the top. The \"anaesthesiologist did not want to give you any more anaesthetics, so that waking up would take less time\" was really pathetic. A few days ago I was operated on at WIM in Warsaw because of acromegaly and I must admit that the tuitaj treatment is pure pleasure compared to your surgery. Unfortunately, but it will not recommend you to anyone, despite the experience that you cannot refuse. Nevertheless, I greet you and wish you to draw conclusions from my opinion.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:The doctor was very specific, he explained all doubts perfectly. It is a pity, however, that he did not have spare paper for the printer (hence this assessment). Unfortunately, I am not in Wroclaw every day and that due to lack of my time I can not pick up the photos. It would be nice to send an e-mail or even SMS. The evaluation is still very positive.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:This is also suggested by research conducted by students of prof. Samoli\u0144ski in the group of ok . 1,500 children from Warsaw's Ochota district. Only 30% of them did not receive the antibiotic before the age of 1 (when the immune system is most sensitive), and before the age of 3 the percentage was 10-14% depending on gender. The analysis revealed that in the group where an allergy developed before the age of 3 (e.g. allergic rhinitis or asthma), most toddlers received an antibiotic. Moreover, in this group, the highest number of children underwent antibiotic therapy repeatedly. \"When having a cold it is better to use OTC drugs (over-the-counter (PAP)), which may not shorten the duration of the infection, but may alleviate its symptoms - to unclog the nose, lower the fever, relieve the cough\" - explained prof . Smoli\u0144ski .\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:Dr. Matyniak is a doctor who knows his work and his profession, knows what he is saying and his behavior indicates a professional approach to the medical profession. On the other hand, he is a doctor and not a miracle worker and you have to wait for the results, although when it hurts you would want to immediately. As far as the visit itself is concerned - nice - in fact, and despite the fact that the doctor is supposedly 15 minutes per patient, he examines until he achieves the expected effect of this examination and in my opinion we should be happy with such young and well-educated doctors because they leave abroad so quickly. The only in minus for the clinic itself, within the framework of the renovation, on average prepared to serve the patients, will stand in the door 45 minutes with a catarrh within - on average it looked - moreover, ladies from the reception desk, despite the fact that at times they were sitting there, four \"pieces\" of them were moderately interested in the patient. There were four of them, one of them was sitting with such faces as if we patients were to disturb them because more important was which one was going on holiday and which of the ladies what she did in her garden - on average it is interesting for us patients, but maybe the private owner prefers to have an empty clinic and a lot of staff.

When she showed him the slides from the CT scan showing the tumor he would see (marked with arrows just in case) he thought that she should consult me again with another radiologist. I was told to do an EUS (for a biopsy) on him - before the examination, the doctor said that he hoped the NFZ would reimburse him for the cost of the examination. The examination should last about 1 - 1 , 5h , the doctor wrapped himself in 20 minutes. He said that everything looks perfect, he took 3 pictures because there was no more sense, there is no trace of tumor. When she asked me where my pain came from, he said that the causes of the pain could be different and he made it clear that I am one of those people who apparently like to get sick of something. She was happy that the tumor had disappeared, but fortunately my doctors did not let this diagnosis fool them. After another abdominal CT, other additional examinations and months of waiting landed me on the operating table where in addition to the removal of a large, hard as concrete tumor I had to resect the digestive tract in three places. The gastrointestinal tract was stiffened. . .

I had 4 fistulas in 1985, including one around the sphincter. After the surgery, which was performed by the doctor himself, it turned out that this fourth fistula did not operate on me. 3 other fistulas were fine. The most difficult fistula was operated on in a military hospital. Dr. Hamdi told me that it is dangerous to operate the fistula around the sphincter because you can damage the sphincter during the operation and \"I'll do it underneath\". My assessment - only \"I recommend\" - is due to the fact that he did not undertake this fistula operation, which he did not inform me about. This is not good. However, if he was not able to operate this fistula, it is good that he did not take it. He could have screwed up the operation and explained that he had warned me. The most important thing in this profession is not to hurt the patient. Besides, he treated me nice and after the second operation in a military hospital he let me come to the hospital to change the dressing. By the way, he watched my second operation (this type of wounds are not sewn up after surgery but they are supposed to cleanse themselves and heal themselves). so he wanted to learn something.

Of course I'll add that the doctor described to me very carefully what and when to use, which I was happy to do, because I didn't even ask 'em for it.

Therefore, the whole examination consisted of questioning the child, which at the age of 4 and serious hearing problems is not very productive. We were also instructed to go and do some tympanometry, which should normally be done on a visit. However, for a 150 PLN visit we expect more. The doctor said that the child hears well and ears are in good condition. And the child hears only when he speaks with his voice raised strongly, so something is wrong. A visit to a good laryngologist and an endoscopic examination a few days later showed fluid in the ears, an oversized third almond and severely impaired hearing. I do not recommend it.",

The room needs to be renovated without delay - maybe it will, because in some parts of the hotel you can see that some work is going on, but... . . Hot water appears and disappears. . . A very loud fan... The towels ( rather old ) are clean; the soap and paper are. Breakfast buffet (buns, butter, naps, coffee, tea, juice) served in the restaurant on the 5th floor (if the elevator breaks down on Saturday, it was fixed only on Monday) with a terrace - you can have breakfast with a view of the city and its whores. Generally I don't break down, especially for longer stays. . .\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:The biggest advantage of the hotel is definitely its location, in the city centre with a private beach opposite the hotel. The hotel and the rooms are clean and impeccable, the towels are changed daily, the floors are washed, the bathroom and the balcony. Large room with fridge safe and wonderful sea view! The hotel also provides animation for guests (even in low season). The food is very good, fresh, mainly European cuisine, but local delicacies are also available. The service is very friendly and helpful. The hotel's spa including hamman new, clean, also worth recommending. We had our stay in the last week of April and I dare to recommend this date. The weather was perfect, no precipitation and temperatures from 23 - 30 degrees. Also at this time, all the plants and flowers bloom, the smell and the view is wonderful! Alanya is a wonderful city, fabulous landscapes, beautiful beaches, warm sea (even in April) and nice people. We will definitely come back in the autumn!\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:What can women's breast implants, a piggy bank, Harry Potter's wand and a bucket of live crabs have in common? Hotel. The hotel, because both the living things, and things were on the list of unusual items left by guests in 527 Travelodge chain facilities around the world and found their way to the office of found things . The hotel chain's hotels also have found the following unusual items: a winning EuroMillions lottery ticket, Bugatti keys, a classer with stamps worth 400 million USD and a Persian cat worth 962 USD, a scenario of a famous soap opera, an inlayed iPhone, a set of artificial teeth with diamonds, a Rolex watch worth 50,000 British pounds, a python brand snake and 76,500 hugs and mascots. As for 13 million people who stayed overnight in 2012 in 38 thousand rooms of Travelodge chain, this is quite a good result. And quite a good cross-section of guests staying in this - there was no budget network.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The hotel is a bit outdated. Bathrooms are actually not in the best condition and have an unpleasant smell. Most of the rooms are overlooking the sea, but there are some with a view. . . .to the back. The rooms are cleaned every day, sometimes more decent and sometimes a little less. The court behind the building is ruined and converted into a gravel pit. The food at the hotel is good, although the breakfasts are the same every day. The swimming pool by the hotel is also quite ok. The mini-markets are very far away and are not well stocked.

Although the website is professionally made, the resort itself does not delight. Standard rooms, nicely furnished but very small. For two people it may be, but for a family with a child it is definitely too cramped. Once you have unfolded the armchair on which the third person sleeps, you cannot open the balcony door, so you have to fold the armchair to the balcony during the day. Smoking on balconies is forbidden - a fine of 100 PLN. The water in the warm bathroom, if someone likes it more than warm, it will simply freeze in the shower. There are no kettles in the rooms and you cannot have your own, because of the electrical installation - words of the receptionist. Room card (key) only one and you can't get another one. The food is very good, very large selection of everything. Very nice ladies waitresses and very nice cleaning ladies. Dinner consisting of two dishes, served to the table. It is not possible to exchange for another dish - if there are served, for example, offal, it is not possible to exchange for anything else. If you don't like something, you just don't eat your dinner - that's the solution of the receptionist, with whom I talked about it. Your receptionist absolutely requires training in the culture of guest service, and the importance of the reception - the business card of the hotel / facility. I recommend to the owner. A playground with modest, dirty sand in the sandbox. High stairs to the beach . To sum up - as I wrote at the beginning - an ordinary small resort. The price was overstated in relation to the quality of services provided, I will certainly not return there.

Our group rented a cottage that did not meet even the lowest standards. A room for 4 people and two beds and one \"bunk\" in the offer for adults is a mockery. In addition, the bed was so old and so complex that any movement on it caused wobbling to the right and left and squeaking (OSH is probably an unknown abbreviation for the owners of this resort). There was no possibility to hang a shower anywhere in the bathroom because the handle was broken. The next thing is the traces of a mushroom coming out in the corners of the walls. Unfortunately, the stains were so huge that they could not be overlooked. We bought our meals in the 'restaurant' too early. which turned out to be an ordinary table and the lowest flights. The most important thing is that the ship is not a luxury, but at least a level for people and not for animals. The canteen offered us the option for vegetarians, which I took advantage of. I was surprised when on the day of my arrival for dinner I was served what I had been served on a regular diet with the only difference that instead of chicken I got a strange, boiled 'mixture' of peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. On the second day I was given a fish while the waitress and cook were very surprised that vegetarians do not eat fish. On the 3rd day she got me a strange 'medallions'. When asked what it was made of, she heard a 'surprise' from the cook. I understand it was supposed to be nice and funny but the day before that the same women gave me the fish and they were very surprised that fish is also meat so how could I trust her and the meal was so ground that she could not recognize its ingredients for anything. Regardless of the price, the conditions should meet the lowest standards. Unfortunately, this place does not meet this standard. Moulds coming out on the walls in the cottages, the lack of a shower holder (not only in our house), squeaking, wobbling beds. Food for vegetarians with cardboard values - none.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Hotel De Goezeput was ideal for our needs during our visit to Bruges and after coming from the USA for the first time. The hotel is located within walking distance of the train station when you head to Oostmeers street (signposts are not too visible). We were warmly welcomed and reporting was easy and fast. We had to bring our suitcases to the second floor, but since we were only going through Belgium and France by train, we packed our lightweight luggage and it was a pleasant transition to the cosy corridors (my wife and I are almost 60 years old!). The room was a delightful room, with ceiling beams and an amazing view of the street outside the hotel and Market Belfry. The room was very large and the bathroom was clean and adequate.

For breakfast on the 1st day there was a \"Swedish table\" - a choice sufficient, but without revelation. On the 2nd day of the stay, as we were told \"due to the small number of guests\" breakfast was served - to choose from several breakfast sets.

The rooms with ocean views are really worth the price: the views will remain in your memory for a long time. Everything about the hotel deserves the highest marks: the rooms are clean, cleaned daily, towels changed on request also daily. The miniature thing for those who love shopping is the considerable distance to the shopping centers. However, the compensation in this respect can be free of charge hotel bus transport to the center (several courses a day, registration at the reception desk) and a bus stop located right next to the hotel (attention: each line has its own bus stop).

In college without a flash drive, it's like in war without a gun. The casing is made of aluminum (read: amelinium), but the inscriptions wear off immediately. The flash drive during read/write, heats up and loses data transfer speed. A bad technical solution, the lanyard hole has a plug on the back, so either you have the lanyard and plug in your hand or you have no lanyard and plug in place. Generally I am disappointed with this pendriver, for which I gave 'em 100 pln.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:A Daimonds toothbrush, but it fits other models (I use the Healthy White toothbrush) and there is no problem with matching the Daimonds toothbrush. I get the impression that they are brighter, not yellowing, plus you can use pastes and lotions that choose and then the results are even better. They are very good for wearing braces. There is no comparison with a regular toothbrush if someone has a problem with the fast build-up of tartar and deposits, as is the case with me.

Unfortunately, it also has its own disadvantages. - The lid opens by about 80 degrees, which makes it difficult to pour water (the tap hooks against the lid).

She had hyaluronic acid injected under her eyes and unfortunately, after the treatment for about a month she looked terrible because I cracked a lot of blood vessels and she looked m m as if she was heavily beaten. Perhaps there was some tendency for my blood vessels to crack, although at the previous doctor (recently moved to Warsaw) nothing like that happened. But what Dr. Rogala injected me remained in the lumps for a very long time, it did not spread evenly, so even at work she had to wear dark glasses during the whole period.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Hello, 7 months ago I had the privilege of meeting Dr. . However, before I met her, I had visited 2 outpatient clinics in Germany, exactly in Hannover, and I was offered to remove 3 teeth including one. (advanced periodontosis, untreated teeth) there were no longer any short-term solutions. The extraction seemed to be unavoidable even because of the fact that the dentists mentioned earlier were in agreement, so I was surprised when the doctor tried to save my dentition. After the first visits, I was surprised by the professionalism and professionalism, but at the same time it made me realize that I can trust both the doctor and the staff who competently coordinate the entire logistics of the office, setting the hours of visits to the needs and capabilities of the patient, confirming and reminding by phone the day before the visit, which is important for a patient leading an intensive professional lifestyle. I can assure you that my teeth were saved, even though the treatment was not finished, thanks to the treatments and prevention that I was recommended. ( Mrs. Dr . found the time to do so ) to make me realize that the effectiveness of the treatment does not depend only on her. Those of you who have had the opportunity to be in dental practices in Germany, Holland or Belgium are sure to find out that this practice represents not only Poland but also Europe with dignity. However, the treatment is professional, effective, painless, and it is thanks to this that the doctor performs his profession with passion and vocation, he has an innate talent for it. That is why I can also recommend the Awansdent Clinic to everyone with a clear conscience, even in situations that would seem hopeless. In case of doubt I can give you my email Greetings to Bogdan\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:The police, and certainly the prosecutor's office, would dispel these hopes: the digital recording of the camera image is not enough evidence for the court due to the ease of manipulation. The employees who were in contact with the fraudsters would not be able to testify unequivocally after a few weeks that the photo presented to them shows the fraudster. When asked: \"Was it that person you handled or a similar person? \"the answer in most cases would be : \"I'm not sure if this one, but a similar one for sure.\" And after the case . The hotel would still be the sponsor of the weekend for a pair of fraudsters. Now let's imagine that when registering, the receptionist asked the guest to write their name, surname, town and sign the registration card by hand.

Unfortunately, every time the problem is in the timely course of the visit because although I am on time and it is a private visit at a certain time, I wait between 20 and 25 minutes under the office. I don't know if the previous patient is late or requires more time for the visit, but if it is, the clinic should work on the right time for the visit for the patients, because even though the last time I waited for 25 minutes, my visit lasted 10 minutes.

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:The hotel is mainly for families with children, couples are strongly advised against going to this hotel. All three available swimming pools were all the time besieged by children swimming on inflatable toys, often of great size, which prevented adults from swimming. Before the hour. 8 a.m., it started to wait for the staff to take off the safety devices from the sun loungers and then fight for them. The number of sun loungers available by the hotel pools was sufficient, but they were in two variants and not all of them were desirable. The sun loungers were dirty, damaged, all in oils, sweat and various drinks. The hotel was mainly occupied by the British, probably from the lower social class - loud and rude. The food is terrible, monotonous, typically prepared for the British: all fried, for breakfast beans, for lunch and dinner fries. It seems every day something different, but in fact, every time it was the same in deep fat. The rooms were cleaned three times a week, but it was limited to just changing towels, restocking toilet paper and washing the sink and bathtub. Only the washbasin itself, already the worktop next to it, or the table in the room remained dirty. Pathetic animations, also addressed to the British. The hotel staff are very kind and polite. Mrs. Kasia resident is not very competent, even discourages to buy an optional tour, the only one organized in Polish. The general impression is not the best, mainly because of the company of the British and the bad food.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Since there is nothing between a medium and a very good rating, I decided to give a very good rating due to the continuous improvement of my service at the hotel. When you decide to go to Albania in general, you have to be aware that nowadays it is a country that is developing as a tourist destination so some shortcomings may appear but are immediately corrected. So what are the good things about the hotel; it is certainly a big (for Albania's standard) swimming pool, where we had a lot of fun. Basically, after crossing the promenade that bordered the hotel was the beach, so you can move freely from the pool to the beach and vice versa. The beach service is free of charge and the staff make sure that everyone finds a place for themselves. We also enjoyed the food. It is not as lavish as it is in other countries, but it is enough not to feel hungry. Lunches and dinners were getting better and better every day and there was never any shortage for anyone. If someone likes sweets very much, then unfortunately, the dessert hotel was dominated by fruit, head watermelons and melons - delicious, sweet and certainly better than a cake with cream. The extremely nice and helpful staff also took care of the comfort of our stay. The hotel room, which is the most important for us, was clean, cleaned daily. It was visible that it was still in the so-called \"finishing\" phase. But it didn't bother us at all, because we spent little time in it and it didn't affect the use of it at all, because all the necessary aspects (bathroom, air-conditioning, comfortable beds) were flawless. At this stage it is a hotel for people who do not mind the lack of lighting on the balcony or the choice of \"only\" two kinds of meat during meals. We are very pleased with the stay in this hotel and Albania, in itself, is so rich in culture, history and landscape that it is worth visiting it.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:In the last place, at the top of the pyramid, there are fats whose consumption should be limited, especially animal fats. \"Since 1992 the consumption of animal fats in the diet of Poles has fallen, which is beneficial, but at the same time the consumption of vegetable fats has increased alarmingly,\" said prof .

My adventure with Magura brakes began with the Julie model, which, even as the lowest model, has always been expensive and ... . One part of users praised it and the other cursed it. I am between these people. When he bought 'em, mounted 'em, etc. his Julie (as a front brake), she was (I'm going to use the female form talking about this brake) excellent. When the pads and disc arrived, Julia had a powerful braking force. Modulation was also high. He was amazed by 'em. A massive caliper and a large 180 cio mm brake disc were doing their job. And so I enjoyed 'em for quite a long time, until. . . Until suddenly, literally from day to day, Julia shot a fool and said that she would never stop decently again. There were then some signs of a willingness to work together, but when at the training, em couldn't brake in front of my buddy and drove 'em into it with all the impetus, this time I shot 'em off the hook and broke 'em off with Julia for good. He tried a lot of things to bring Julia back to her former glory, but to no avail.

They booked it about 5 weeks earlier and decided to stay at the place where we were 17 years ago. Well, the hotel hasn't changed much, although it has taken over the hotel next door, giving it an extra pool for adults. The entertainment was still at the same high level and the food was fine but not the best we ate although we had plenty of choice and there was enough. The rooms were of the right size and clean, and if the room overlooks the pool, there are beautiful views of the bay. All in all, the hotel is great and we enjoyed it all week long. The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from the centre of San Antonio and so convenient for those who want to visit the bars and clubs (although most were closed when we were there). The island is easily accessible by local buses, so there is no need to rent a car. Would they stop us at the Tanit Hotel again? Yes, because it is located in a quiet part of the resort, but close by, which will appeal to younger people who want to go out.\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Today, customers, that is our guests, are looking for something different than what is everywhere. What do you offer different? We try to be different than everyone else. Our resort is founded on a SPA plus hotel. As a rule, the SPA is an addition to the hotel, with us it is the opposite. SPA is the basis of a wide range of wellness, massages, oriental rituals and a set of specialized, high quality cosmetic services. And what fits under the term wellness we also have, of course, that is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, saunas, baths, salt cave.

    "input": "I bought 'em two Manta navigations, for myself and a friend. I was tempted by the low price and the fact that you can install AutoMapa . The purchase was made on 11 February 2017 and during those few months I can say with a clear conscience that it was the worst purchase in my life. Navigation often freezes (the map is frozen), it is hard to start it, often even a hard reset does not help. You have to connect it under the home charger and it will graciously start. If it loses the signal it catches it very long and sometimes only hard reset helps. The messages pop up on the screen and when you press ok the navigation resets itself. Using it is so tiring to me that I have had enough of it. Two Polish companies, i.e. Manta and AutoMapa, can't get along to make it work well, I am extremely disappointed. I believe that Manta abuses the information in its description, and I quote. However, there is nothing to prevent the user from installing another car navigation application on their own, such as MapaMap or Auto Mapa, which says that their device is compatible with AutoMapa, no, it does not, and it is the same with the other navigation system.

Professional service at the reception desk during check-in, worse dealing with guests' requests for stay.

In the room you received you could smell like from an ashtray. Opening the window, which can only be opened, did not improve the situation.

This specialist is not guided by the patient's welfare, MISCELLANEOUS. . . This doctor was approached by me based on opinions from the Internet. She enrolled me at the nfz clinic, then she also enrolled my daughter there, who has been treated under the control of this doctor to this day. One beautiful day she received a phone call from the school asking her to take the child complaining about the earache and suffering.

I don't know how it will be later and what effects the treatment will have. Anyway, he said: \"You are not worried, you will have a child, but you need to put your health in order\". He gave his mobile phone and said he was always on the phone and would answer questions if I didn't know something. The only thing that worried me was that he didn't put a card on me.

There were enough soft drinks and alcoholic drinks in the all-inclusive option - some other alcoholic drinks during the day in the pool bar, others from 18 in the lobby bar.

He gave his mobile phone and said he was always on the phone and would answer questions if I didn't know something. The only thing that worried me was that he didn't put a card on me. He didn't write anything down etc. He looked only at my research (and there were a lot of it) and wrote me down what and how. However, he did not write anything down at home. The next visit he made was quite fast, again with an ultrasound, but in case of my ailment he would not see the results otherwise. So far, apart from the change of medication and the next visit he did not order me anything. He just announced what else awaits me.

    "input": "As Dr Tabaszewska explains, low molecular weight proteins can penetrate through the skin to its deeper layers. In this way they influence skin hydration and nourishment. On the other hand, proteins of high molecular weight remain on the skin surface. A thin but tight layer of the cosmetic, so called occlusal film, prevents water loss. Properly moisturized skin looks healthier and younger, there are fewer wrinkles and those that can be seen are shallower. Thanks to their specific structure, proteins can form various forms affecting the stability of the final product. This is important because cosmetics contain many different ingredients that affect and react to each other. The mixture, e.g. gel or cream, must maintain an appropriate solid consistency. Therefore, in the development of new cosmetics, researchers must combine the necessary substances in such a way as to obtain durable products with a specific structure. A big challenge for the Cracow team was the fact that the new emulsion containing whey protein concentrate consists only of natural resources. The natural raw materials are less standardized in comparison to synthetic substances, i.e. it is more difficult to determine the stable composition and proportions of the cosmetic.",

The cost of dishes with service and drinks is 220 z\u0142 / person, and the service is chaos one great amateur. I am very sorry that I decided to have a wedding in this place expecting that for a considerable amount of money I will meet with professionalism. Despite the arrangements with the hotel, the details in practice differed significantly. For example, we have established that 2 waiters will serve us in the room, and in fact, one waiter brings food from the kitchen to the bar and another serves it on the tables. And so 21 people are served cold broth for 40 minutes by one waiter. At the very entrance, there were only sodas on the tables and it was this one waiter between serving the broth that got the salad and water, which we had to ask for. The water was not given to us on the tables until after a few reminders. The logistics of serving dishes was an equally big surprise, i.e. scions and after 20 minutes of sauce to scions, tartar and after 20 minutes of bread or fries at the end of dinner. Vodka was supposed to stand on the tables in coolers, and until the end of the party it stood loose on the table. The chef had no idea about the cakes brought by the confectionery to the hotel in the morning. Again, the search for a cake ended with a successful service. After the dough, he and the waiter agreed that he would take it from the table and serve dinner directly. This directness ended with over an hour-long picture of empty tables (vodka and drinks alone). Beautiful pictures will come out, the wedding for 220 PLN / wasps, and the tables were empty, there was not even a snack for vodka. And again a reminder, a man instead of entertaining guests looked for service and made them aware of what was happening on the tables. He got 'em to deal with the staff so that the next day they packed me the remaining lunch and they also did it with the fact that I had to go to them 2 times because after the first approach they only gave me a cake and a cold buffet (which they found out when they came back home). After the phone call I made, suddenly there was a cake and meat dishes. No scriptwriter would have come up with such a mess and chaos. I warn potential customers of this hotel against organizing a failed event.

He gave his mobile phone and said he was always on the phone and would answer questions if I didn't know something. The only thing that worried me was that he didn't put a card on me. He didn't write anything down etc. He looked only at my research (and there were a lot of it) and wrote me down what and how. However, he did not write anything down at home. The next visit he made was quite fast, again with an ultrasound, but in case of my ailment he would not see the results otherwise. So far, apart from the change of medication and the next visit he did not order me anything. He just announced what else awaits me. I'll see how it goes on and I'll say again, maybe even give a rating. P . S . My friend was at his place once, because she thought she was pregnant (not having an intercourse in principle - when she told me what and how, I understand him in part). ...he's supposed to have made a joke of it.

Before that, she was m sceptical about homeopathy and for 2 years she carried my phone number in her pocket. My son was a premature child and from a very young age, he suffered from bronchitis which turned into pneumonia. She went with him to the pediatrician who applied 2 antibiotics a month, he went to kindergarten for 5 years - a week in kindergarten - 2 weeks sick and so on and on. He did not go to kindergarten at all because of constant infections, she was afraid that he would not be able to cope in 1st class. The pediatrician told me that she couldn't help him, she suggested the hospital. The allergologist still only inhalation medicines, zyrtec and zero improvement. She told me enough - and she made an appointment for my first visit to the Institute of Homeopathy, where I was sent to Mrs. Annie. It was May 2005 . Since then my son hasn't been taking antibiotics, which doesn't mean he wasn't sick at all. We stopped all traditional medicines, he only takes homeopathic medicines and finally we live normally. What was our joy when we could go sledding with a healthy son in winter. I am very grateful to the doctor for being so generous in helping the little patients anyway.

Two stars for the location and beautiful views . Nevertheless, the rest, and especially the hotel staff leaves much to be desired. Vodka was not spread on the tables after 1:00, guests had to go to the fridge and take it themselves. Warm meals served on the table of the bride and groom at the very end. No one in the room was cleaning at all on the day of the wedding, and on the day of the amendments almost no one was cleaning at all. The hotel was 95% rented, and the lady at the reception made a scene on Sundays that the guests did not return the keys. These guests had just paid for another day at the hotel two hours earlier, as well as no organization. However, the biggest disgust leaves a situation where the witness asked the staff for help in cleaning up one of the guests. She was told to clean up herself and said that the bride and groom should take into account the fact that somebody can mess it up and they should clean it up themselves. The question then arises, why did we pay so much money for the wedding? I sincerely discourage everyone who is willing to do so.

Before this whole treatment she did not feel any pain and after the \"treatment\" I still feel it. She would rather give this money away for free than treat it again in the doctor's office.

The properties of the blood - specifically haemoglobin, whose oxidized form interacts with light in a different way than the reduced form - are important here. This phenomenon allows to assess the degree of oxygenation of the observed part of the body by analysing the intensity of light penetrating the tissue. The basic elements of optical diagnostic devices are small light sources (laser diodes) and sensitive photodetectors. Sources and detectors, usually 2 - 5 cm apart, are put together in pairs.

I would like to ask for an answer and greet you very warmly.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:The hotel is decent. Nothing delights, nothing rejects. The hotel's style is negative - it looks more like an old office building. There are large breakfasts served, however, one should pay attention whether NATO soldiers are not staying in the hotel at the same time (which happens often). Coming for breakfast after their visit misses the goal, because the gentlemen eat very much and very quickly.\nAnswer:ambivalent",

Determine whether given Question is positive, negative, neutral or ambivalent in terms of its sentiment:\n\nQuestion:Welcome to the hotel Kriamos Blue spent 15 days in the hotel. I travel a lot so maybe I have a comparison with standards in different countries. In general, Greece has quite an old-fashioned hotel facilities from here it fell on the hotel \"freshly\" renovated. And in fact the hotel Matina was built in Kriamos, the canteen was added, the lobby pool was renovated and the rooms were given a better shine, a work of art. Fantastic service including a sensational Solon room manager, the only plus of this hotel. But to the point and one by one. The first and most important thing is the food so praised, in the pictures which is so picturesque magnificent and is piled up pouring out of the tables. The truth is quite different. In this hotel we use artificial honey, margarine, frying everything on a fritz, canned fruit, no baked goods except for the market cakes for 1 euro, in a word, cutting it is a pity that in the kitchen. The way of preparing the dishes, their taste, appearance and somehow the products below criticism, if a tourist from Poland praises it, expect that this is the level of Tesco Value, no matter what. After 3 days I had such intestinal problems that until the end of the trip I was dining in restaurants. Never in my life have I met such a disgusting food which overshadowed other insignificant defects such as: Lack of glasses in the rooms and a ban on bringing cutlery and plates into the rooms (the cleaning service was recuperating) Lack of coverage / breaking the Internet nightmare in the rooms (2 days there was no Internet because the hotel did not pay the bill and they disconnected) Cracked and torn out the plates from the pool and greased dirty sides of the poolfront. Honestly as a very reticent man in general in issuing his negative opinions, the first time I experienced such a failure, paid em a lot of money and the hotel attracted me only that it is for adults and there will be no children. I prefer children to animal food. I recommend all Lindos and Rhodes, beautiful old towns. I would advise against Faliraki - two streets crossed by a ton of indulgenced fake shops from China, for dirt, everywhere thrown away, yuck.\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:Hotel located directly on the lake. The view from our room is magical ( level - 1 ) of the spreading lake. . . All rooms are similarly decorated, very comfortable and spacious. The only difference is the view from the window. Fantastic breakfasts, despite the winter, lots of salads and vegetables. The service is very courteous although you can see a lack of training. Of course it's the beginning, the hotel is brand-new, but an honest assessment requires this attention. You can see a good idea, the architect and interior decorator must be appreciated. Now only the landlord must provide customer service. And we hope that you will not regret it and here the means will certainly pay off. The hotel borders on the Restaurant Marina, where you can pamper the palate: - ) . There is a SPA in the hotel, which is managed by an excellent and very professional Ms. Anna. May the whole staff be such, then success is guaranteed. The swimming pool with a view of the lake and saunas invite you to relax.

The hotel, because both the living things, and things were on the list of unusual items left by guests in 527 Travelodge chain facilities around the world and found their way to the office of found things . The hotel chain's hotels also have found the following unusual items: a winning EuroMillions lottery ticket, Bugatti keys, a classer with stamps worth 400 million USD and a Persian cat worth 962 USD, a scenario of a famous soap opera, an inlayed iPhone, a set of artificial teeth with diamonds, a Rolex watch worth 50,000 British pounds, a python brand snake and 76,500 hugs and mascots. As for 13 million people who stayed overnight in 2012 in 38 thousand rooms of Travelodge chain, this is quite a good result. And quite a good cross-section of guests staying in this - there was no budget network.\nAnswer:neutral\nQuestion:From the outside, the building is unlikely to impress, but the center is very decent. Spacious illuminated hall with bar, nice conference and party room, and rooms really big and above all clean. It's really nice to stay in them. Another advantage is the large selection of products during a meal. There is also a swimming pool and saunas. However, the downside of this complex is the temperature in the rooms - colloquially speaking, you can just freeze there. P . S .

Compared to another hotel in this village, the description is done without a comparative scale. But objectively, it is not difficult to make such an assessment when the scale of differences resulting from the price list itself speaks about it directly and clearly. Range of services, rich offer. For those who like luxury and have unnecessary financial resources, yes .\nAnswer:positive\nQuestion:Interestingly, in Krakow's hostels in these holidays the prices for accommodation in double rooms were higher than in 3 * hotels. For example, in the cult hostel Good By Lenin a room cost 150 - 160 zloty with breakfast and in the hotel Best Western Galicya you could buy it on booking.com for 124 zloty. And an air-conditioned room in a 4 * Swing hotel cost 200 zloty. And in the hostel there were no free rooms and in the hotels - yes . What makes customers pay such prices for a low, hostel standard?

And so I had a dilemma: laptop or charger? - The tower - it's probably about the non-functioning radio dummy? - Hotel towels - were ! - A refrigerator - maybe on the windowsill. But it only works in winter. On a hot May night I had no use for it. To tell you the truth, the room I occupied was only suitable for sleeping - there was a bed and a couch. Unfortunately, there wasn't even one chair, desk or bedside lamp. So you can forget about comfortable work. . . There was also no wardrobe for clothes, its role is played by a rotating hanger. Not very functional solution. Breakfast - to put it mildly - without revelation . Ready-made set - a pair of cold meat slices and yellow cheese . The only choice is a version with scrambled eggs or warm sausages. Lunch menu is much more varied, but quite expensive.",

Nearly 100 people invited to the opening ceremony visited the hotel, got to know the staff, but most of all congratulated the building to the investor and had fun at the inaugural party. Hot and cold buffets were prepared by the hotel kitchen under the supervision of the Chef - Artur Raven.

I am very disappointed with my approach to the patient (I was given a clear understanding that if something had happened to me because of the chewing gum that I had forgotten to get rid of before entering the office, it would have been more of a problem with the lengthening of the queue than my health) and the approach to the treatment itself. I was discouraged from desensitization. He got em an irrational explanation for the cat allergy. In addition, em was treated like a child, despite being of the right age. I do not recommend .\nAnswer:negative\nQuestion:The doctor has a lot of knowledge. She looks at the patient as a whole and not just through the prism of an organ that is sick. She has helped me not only to improve the condition of the chronically ill intestines, but she has also distracted me from other doctors' ideas, which are not necessarily the right ones. The doctor contributed to the fact that after 3 years of effort I managed to get pregnant when other doctors claimed that my intestinal disease has no effect on fertility. A big plus for the possibility of telephone consultations, thanks to which you do not have to commute for visits and consultations from other Polish cities. The treatment is not short term but effective.

If someone has time to make such an appointment, I recommend it because I am sure she knows her profession well. Of course the visit ended with buying glasses.
